You could say every node is an Agora index, in the sense that it's a point from where to start navigating. And I start Agora indexes as a hobby :)

(I was checking out random locations and I found that [[Agora index]] somehow made for a good index even thought it was empty until I wrote this in the stoa. For example it led me to [[Agora slides]] and many other interesting locations.)
