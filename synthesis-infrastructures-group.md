- [[Breakout rooms]] synthesis (in common)
  - someone asked about [[commmons]] that have scaled well, good question

    - [[patterns]] for [[incentivizing synthesis]]
      - [[authors]]
      - something based on [[model cards]]  
      - [[patterns languages]]
        - https://synthesis-infrastructures.wiki/Social_Systems
        - [[scrum patterns]] used [[towns, buildings, construction]] as reference
      - [[angelina lesnikova]] how to properly do metrics for incentivization?
      - [[flancian]] [[agora]] :)
      - [[jonny]]
          - [[private bitcoin trackers]] -- what do they do right?
          - [[p2p]] systems that are self sustaining
              - they make it a social process
              - they have a role to play: overlays that require an additional effort
              - independence or interdependence with a [[credit assignment system]]
          - #al decision making, giving it as a right to the community
          - [[ronen tamari]] how platforms capture data that could be used to do [[credit assignment]], reclaiming this data for the community
          - #al [[funding]] has been one of the leading incentive mechanisms

      - but notes presented are in a [[google doc]]
      - arriving at alignment
      - incentivizing succesfully changing our minds
      - do we need a license or agreement?
      - "what is the linked data"? (what is the work?)
      - [[jay]]: [[evidence map]], recognizing people, recognition tiers

        - helping scholars find each other's work
        - curating content
        - micro contributions to discourse
        - sharing attention or endorsement
        - it's hard to currently find all meta (e.g. reviews, comments, annotations) for a given resource
        - "given some URL or ar reference for a paper", give me all X related to it/aggregate them
        - [[minimum viable product]] that could arise: 
            - notes that researchers take *while* they do (read) research
            - [[flancian]] https://hypothes.is is doing well in this space
  - #push [[michael toomim]] recognizing entities/short names in [[mastodon]], [[jonny saunders]]'s work on [[wiki bot]] and dumping to [[semantic media wiki]].
      - [[braid]] (!)
      - Michael ~ https://github.com/toomim -> https://braid.org, very cool, I was tracking it
  - [[jonny saunders]]
      - what is some way of accessing and providing linked data directly in [[mastodon]]?
      - [[amy]] some external link resolving
      - https://masto.synthesis-infrastructures.wiki is an experimental [[mastodon]] instance for the wiki
      - their approach uses [[jonny:wiki:foo]] for writing to [[foo]] IIUC
      - [[semantic mediawiki]] uses a [[property::object]] scheme
  - [[amy zhang]] created something complementary to [[jonny]]'s!
      - [[bot]] approach
      - something that can bootstrap off what people are already doing -- what's the least extra that they can do?
      - trying to bootstrap from paper announcements
      - if someone makes an announcement post of their paper, if they add an identifier in it in the form (username:string)
      - the bot will respond to that post with a link to the announcement and the original paper announcement of the paper
      - see https://masto.synthesis-infrastructures.wiki/@Synthbot/109335372976261537
      - using social more as a [[primary data store]]
      - [[joel chan]] do you think this can be trialed in [[unsure]]?
      - [[amy zhang]] how to agree on hashtags/short forms/ways to identify papers?
      - [[flancian]] [[wikilinks]]
      - [[sam klein]] are you thinking of keeping a separate index of hashtags somewhere?
      - [[toomin]] no good database yet
  - [[wayne lutters]] environmental components that enable shared models -- [[interdisciplinary models]]

          - dataset in [[pdf]]
          - used [[obsidian]], got excited about the possibilities
          - would like to convert to [[markdown]]

          - revisiting past projects, process
