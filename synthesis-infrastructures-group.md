          - [[p2p]] systems that are self sustaining
              - they make it a social process
              - they have a role to play: overlays that require an additional effort

        - sharing attention or endorsement
        - it's hard to currently find all meta (e.g. reviews, comments, annotations) for a given resource

      - [[braid]] (!)
      - Michael ~ https://github.com/toomim -> https://braid.org, very cool, I was tracking it
  - [[jonny saunders]]
      - what is some way of accessing and providing linked data directly in [[mastodon]]?
      - [[amy]] some external link resolving
      - https://masto.synthesis-infrastructures.wiki is an experimental [[mastodon]] instance for the wiki
      - their approach uses [[jonny:wiki:foo]] for writing to [[foo]] IIUC
      - [[semantic mediawiki]] uses a [[property::object]] scheme
  - [[amy zhang]] created something complementary to [[jonny]]'s!
      - [[bot]] approach
      - something that can bootstrap off what people are already doing -- what's the least extra that they can do?
      - trying to bootstrap from paper announcements
      - if someone makes an announcement post of their paper, if they add an identifier in it in the form (username:string)
      - the bot will respond to that post with a link to the announcement and the original paper announcement of the paper
      - see https://masto.synthesis-infrastructures.wiki/@Synthbot/109335372976261537
      - using social more as a [[primary data store]]
      - [[joel chan]] do you think this can be trialed in [[unsure]]?
      - [[amy zhang]] how to agree on hashtags/short forms/ways to identify papers?

          - [[the hero's journey]]
          - understand literature, conversation, science research: the [[discourse graph]]
              - we have seen [[discourse graphs]]... but not many for some reason.
              - most of us have not taken it beyond an individual graph level
                  - one implementation: [[roam research discourse graph]]
              - [[universal federation of discourse graphs]] ~ [[united federation of discourse graphs]]
                  - [[naming]] is necessary for querying
                      - want to implement a particular data model which is documented in the wiki proper
                  - they mention the [[agora]] (!)
              - #push [[agora protocol]]
                  - #meta [[question]] [[claim]] tagging looks very nice
          - stage two of the journey: [[the abyss]]
              - we're reimplementing so much per tool, why don't we just rely on mediawiki?
              - but what we're trying to really build here is a [[process]], a [[pattern language]]
          - [[karola kirsanow]] rocks
      - [[kyle m]] 
          - goal for the weekend: work with [[discourse graphs as data]]
          - new to [[sparql]] but is adding a [[tools]] section to the wiki

      - [[konrad hinsen]] 
          - [[federated future]]
          - tried annotating on [[mediawiki]] and felt [[friction]]
              - writing tools that enable better annotation during and after writing
          - how can we collaborate on the same graphs and representations given our diversity of backgrounds, the different tags/terminology we'd use?

              - [[massive wiki]]
      - [[metasj]] 
         - on [[naming]] and [[scope]]
         - it starts with: why are we doing this? which kind of discourse would be like to support?
         - we're doing this so that people working on compatible ideas can find each other and each other's arguments
         - priority; getting a few hundred discourse graphs, examples of questions that have been answered this way, which of course supports short and long form hypotheses
         - in an example, as we were trying to sketch out a discourse in the wiki, we did this at the level of section headers
         - advantages of systems that support [[transclusion]]
         - [[short hand is used in large contexts]]
      - [[deniz aydemir]]
          - joined late but would like to point out a few salient points
          - konrad mentioned that we need to remember the user perspective, how to meet the user where they are
      - [[karola kirsanow]]
          - call out: if you can annotate your notes with [[discourse graph]] tools, please do so and we'll try to work on integrating :)
