      - Michael ~ https://github.com/toomim -> https://braid.org, very cool, I was tracking it
  - [[jonny saunders]]
      - what is some way of accessing and providing linked data directly in [[mastodon]]?
      - [[amy]] some external link resolving
      - https://masto.synthesis-infrastructures.wiki is an experimental [[mastodon]] instance for the wiki
      - their approach uses [[jonny:wiki:foo]] for writing to [[foo]] IIUC
      - [[semantic mediawiki]] uses a [[property::object]] scheme
  - [[amy zhang]] created something complementary to [[jonny]]'s!
      - [[bot]] approach
      - something that can bootstrap off what people are already doing -- what's the least extra that they can do?
      - trying to bootstrap from paper announcements
      - if someone makes an announcement post of their paper, if they add an identifier in it in the form (username:string)
      - the bot will respond to that post with a link to the announcement and the original paper announcement of the paper
      - see https://masto.synthesis-infrastructures.wiki/@Synthbot/109335372976261537

              - we have seen [[discourse graphs]]... but not many for some reason.
              - most of us have not taken it beyond an individual graph level

              - #push [[agora protocol]]
                  - #meta [[question]] [[claim]] tagging looks very nice
          - stage two of the journey: [[the abyss]]
              - we're reimplementing so much per tool, why don't we just rely on mediawiki?
              - but what we're trying to really build here is a [[process]], a [[pattern language]]
          - [[karola kirsanow]] rocks

          - how can we collaborate on the same graphs and representations given our diversity of backgrounds, the different tags/terminology we'd use?

         - on [[naming]] and [[scope]]
         - it starts with: why are we doing this? which kind of discourse would be like to support?
         - we're doing this so that people working on compatible ideas can find each other and each other's arguments
         - priority; getting a few hundred discourse graphs, examples of questions that have been answered this way, which of course supports short and long form hypotheses
         - in an example, as we were trying to sketch out a discourse in the wiki, we did this at the level of section headers
         - advantages of systems that support [[transclusion]]
         - [[short hand is used in large contexts]]
      - [[deniz aydemir]]
          - joined late but would like to point out a few salient points
