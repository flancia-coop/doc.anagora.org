        - [x] edit <- now working
        - [x] write
        - [ ] export to docs
            - footnotes don't export well by copy/pasting :)
            - might be a good ocassion to do it properly
    - #push [[agora docs import]]
        - sounds like a detour but productive, and it *is* needed to make editing of the chapter later (if it gets accepted) Agora-compatible
        - [ ] code
            - [[docs]] -> [[agora]]
                - [ ] [[hardcode]] fetching the [[agora doc]] URL to begin with
                - [ ] then generalize
            - [[agora]] -> [[docs]]
                - maybe add an endpoints to [[agora server]] which exports the rendered subnode as [[html]]?
                - this was something we wanted for other purposes already I think
