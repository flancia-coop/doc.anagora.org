Tataghatagharba is a term in Buddhist philosophy that refers to the innate, pure potential for enlightenment within all beings. It is also known as Buddha nature or Buddhood. This concept is a central teaching in many schools of Mahayana Buddhism and is believed to be the fundamental, unchanging nature of all sentient beings.

Here are a few related entities:

    [[Mahayana Buddhism]]: a major branch of Buddhism that emphasizes the path of the bodhisattva, a person who seeks enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.
    [[Buddha nature]]: the inherent potential for enlightenment within all beings, also known as Buddhahood.
