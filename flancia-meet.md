    - Why the distinction/hard cut?
    - About Borges...
        - [[The library of Babel]]
        - [[Death and the compass]]
            - Completely different style, more like a police story, representative of a certain kind of short story he produced

# [[flancia meet 2025-03-08]]
- [[bouncepaw]] [[flancian]]
- [[AI revolution]] 
    - in many senses?
    - revolutionize/disrupt work:
        - tough for junior developers
        - yet the code being generated is still kind of bad
    - aid the revolution
        - seems potentially unlikely, maybe counterproductive as it will allow corporations to concentrate the power
- [[bug hunting]]
    - difficult without whole-system intuition
    - hard to track bugs
- plans for the weekend
- [[betula]] update
    - [[archiving]] shipped!
        - see [[betula archival]] node
        - very cool
        - not available on links.flancia.org yet but looking forward to updating/using it
    - next step: search each other bookmark's without leaving betula
        - [[agora search]] could be implemented along these same lines?
    - and [[remarks]] :)
- [[syncthing]] sharing
- [[bhi backups]]
- [[mycoverse search]]
- [[agora oauth]]
    - maybe the time is coming?
    - what could a user do once logged in?
        - edit?
        - -> [[bull]] and multi user hosting
        

# [[flancia meet 2025-01-25]]

- [[flancian]] doing generally cleanup and planning :)
    - installed [[llm]] CLI by [[simonw]] and had fun after setting up API keys for: [[openai]] [[mistral] [[google]] 
    - [[gemini]] was the hardest (needlessly, as usual) because I had to use a VPN to be able to create an API key due to random enterprise-y large-company restrictions

# [[flancia meet 2024-02-24]]
- [[flancian]] doing generally cleanup and planning

    - [[bouncepaw]] working on betula today, maybe tomorrow spending time with friends
    - [[bouncepaw]] [[poetry lecture]] and [[boardgames]] on Monday
    - [[bouncepaw]] time with friends
- @bouncepaw@links.bouncepaw.com lost all followers while trying to fix the database
    - resubscribe 
        - done!
        - the receiving server must respond to a follow with accept follow -- which panda.anagora.org doesn't do currently
- [[federated search]] seems interesting but not a priority
    - fanning out to 'friend instances'
    - https://links.bouncepaw.com/tag/federated_search
    - there *must* be an existing protocol for this? fan out search queries, get back structured URLs directly or as a callback?
- [[opensearch]] sounds fun
    - should add this to [[betula]] and [[mycorrhiza]] too
    - [[chromium]] is a bit of a pain to deal with, but when it works it's great
- [[flancian]] sharing work plan, fediverse/sqlite/neobooks as per today's journal
    - [[neobooks]] concept
    - embedding
    - [[oembed]] might have been effectively replaced by [[opengraph]]
    - [[transclusion]] seems key, but [[agora speed]] is probably a painpoint that is relevant -- people would not transclude the agora if it's super slow
        - on the other hand, it should be cached?
- [[federation]] overall is more important than [[federated search]]
    - overlaps with coursework :)
    - [[flancian]] will try to tag along
    - [[activitypub testing]]:
        - official test suite has been dead for at least four years: https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues/337
        - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/the-activitypub-test-suite/290/38 might be an alternative

                    - Gaming.
                    - Flancian: loved adventure games in the 1990s, and [[simcity]]. Then got back into gaming with [[Half Life]] and Half Life 2.

            - [[Cyber cafes]] in the 00s
        - [[FOTL]] and [[interwiki links]]
            - Because URLs exist already and they work, we need to justify the addition of interwiki links
        - [[wikilinks]] do not make wikis.
            - [[betula]] website uses wikilinks, but is no wiki: https://betula.mycorrhiza.wiki
        - What is massive about [[massive wiki]]? It's its massive intentions!
        - What do we think about the [[indieweb]]?
            - It's cool and large
            - "Own your identity" is important, but...
            - [[Timur]] likes its [[micro formats]] and [[inter site communication]]
                - [[Betula]] produces [[indieweb microformats]]
                - Took 20 minutes to add! And now potentially thousands of people can reblog
                - Can we build [[mycoverse]] on top of [[indieweb]], developing new microformats
            - #push [[do]]
                - [[Timur]] believes we should add [[microformats]] to [[agora]]
                    - [[h-entry]] for chronological content
                    - [[h-feed]] is a collection of [[h entries]]
        - [[agora 2023]]
            - more formats
                - [[mycomarkup]]
                    - unlike [[markdown]], it is developed by basically one person
                        - [[markdown]] is an [[anarchist]] [[markup language]]
                - [[argdown]]
                - [[gemtext]]
                - maybe [[html]] as the intermediate format that [[agora bridge]] produces when it detects that a consumed item is not ready to be served by agora server?
            - more sources
                - not only pulling from git
                - could use microformats to understand where everything is
                - [[agora.yaml]] could be a manifest
            - [[block protocol]]? https://blockprotocol.org
        - [[mastodon]]
            - on the signup experience
                - [[mastodon app]] on android is pretty good at this
                - now we have joinmastodon.org which is pretty good too, but very mastodon specific
                - it's very much not about the wider fediverse
            - engagement and discoverability
                - discovery is hard
                - the maybe over-stressing of mastodon in everything mastodon related w.r.t. the wider [[fediverse]]
                - we want [[pluralism]], but [[mastodon]] is a bit of a monoculture currently?
        - [[betula]] release announcement
            - easier to type than [[mycorrhiza]]

# #push [[flancia meet 2022-10-29]]
- Attending: [[bouncepaw]] [[handlerug]] [[flancian]]
- [[bouncepaw]] Crazy week, lots of social activity, but nice
    - [[merveilles migration]]
        - https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/merveille
    - https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw
    - will try the migration flow tonight
    - user information is updated daily ([[handlerug]] read the code); now a new user has been fetched, you need to wait ~1d for it to be refetched
    - TLDR: set up redirection first, then make the last post on the old profile (in future migrations)
    - pronounced close to [[mahr vei]]
- [[flancian]] [[agora chapter]] is current focus for this weekend
    - also [[social coop]] admin / on call
    - broken registration flow because of spam trap
    - https://social.coop/about
    - [[spam trap]] was triggering
        - hidden field, supposed to be left empty
        - but the field was named 'surname'
        - so autocomplete engines were triggering and filling it in, thus making it trigger for normal users
- [[in the arcades]] is a good [[hypertext]] book
- [[planning]] the weekend :)
    - [[bouncepaw]]
        - assignments
            - calculus: Gotta prepare for the pseudo-exam, don't wannaaaaa
            - creativity: I don't like the assignment, might ignore it
                - enough credits
            - english: Done already
            - mathematical logic: Will ignore
            - probability theory: I didn't take the copybook here, so I can't do it (what a shame)
            - object oriented programming: Don't wanaaaaa, I hate Visual Studio aaaa
                - issues with hardware / memory limitations
        - finish the merveilles migration
        - work on [[mycorrhiza]]!?
            - haven't really put a lot of effort in two months
    - [[flancian]] 
        - [[agora chapter]] in good shape by tomorrow night, hopefully by tonight
        - two feature requests
            - [[interwiki]] support in anagora.org
                - -> hopefully by mid November
                - [[bouncepaw]] [[jonny]] tried using the colon syntax with the bot at some point
                    - https://social.coop/@jonny/109135233389666304
                    - https://lor.sh/web/@jonny@social.coop/109135233647883067
                    - meta: is there full text search in mastodon?
                    - none that we've found to work widely, would be interested in finding one or solving this
            - write a long form answer to [[bouncepaw]]'s great questions about the future that were asked in private messages :)
        - [[agora ux improvements]]
            - I have a laundry list of small improvements to the UI that I hope to start going through
        - [[agora bot]] has some bugs
            - might fix them? like hashtag handling
            - then try to move to writing through api.anagora.org
    - [[handlerug]]
        - #push [[ragamuffin]] is an [[activity pub]] gateway
            - [[golang]]
                - [[harelang]] wouldn't work for that
            - [[bouncepaw]] came up with the name!
            - something like [[GoToSocial]]? https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/
            - trying to defrag identity in the fediverse
            - [[solid]] related? ([[tim berners lee]]'s project)
            - consists of an identity server (OAuth2 and ActivityPub provider) and multiple frontends
            - [[indieweb]] related? initially meant to be a microblogging server
            - could be an identity provider for anagora.org
            - related: https://microblog.pub
            - [[webfinger]]: https://indieweb.org/WebFinger
- [[html]] tag `<details>`
    - good for UI!
- [[handlerug]]
    - in maybe temporary location, liking [[Istanbul]]
    - many friends are attending university back in Russia and that should be safe for them; drafting is very rare for university students
    - IT workers do get drafted often (in 2022) but it doesn't usually happen with students
- [[flancian]] know first and second-order Russian friends in Turkey, Israel

# #push [[flancia meet 2022-09-24]]
- Attending: [[bouncepaw]] [[flancian]]
- [[computer typesetting]] course
    - [[Microsoft Word]]
    - [[latex]] ~ [[LaTeX]]
- [[planning]]
    - [[agora bridge]]
        - -> fix twitter bot, refactor (ideally with code sharing between [[mastodon]] and [[twitter]])
        - -> bring up one API method, likely to write to a node (so agora server ui can write through the api)
    - [[agora server]]
        - [[canonical nodes]] -> move to + / urlencoded across the board (would like to discuss)
        - fix bug with wikipedia [[autopull]] (do not pull if the user has pulled already, I knew this didn't work but I coded it lazily anyway)
    - [[agora]]
        - update [[hypatia]] (agor.ai)
        - bring up another Agora (which one? shamanic? but I don't have repositories for that from the group yet? zero precedent maybe, or [[ogm]] as there's [[Jerry's Brain]])
    - [[stoa]]
        - oauth for hedgedoc?
        - I sometimes miss the simplicity of [[etherpad]] (also thinking of Microsoft Word / [[WYSIWYG]])
            - There was supposed to be a plugin (or fork?) of [[etherpad]] supporting [[wikilinks]] but I never found it.
- [[slugging]]
    - 'Hello World!' -> 'hello-world'
    - s/[ !\?^]+/-/g
    - [[Flancia meet]] is https://anagora.org/flancia-meet
    - I liked this a lot when starting, made things easier. The advantages are:
        - mapping between web apps
        - there is 1:1 mapping between Agora nodes and HedgeDoc, because HedgeDoc uses slugs
        - same with Jitsi Meet, flancia-meet works as well
    - Disadvantages are:
        - information loss, it is lossy by design
        - for example: [[free, fair and alive: the insurgent power of the commons]] -> [[free-fair-and-alive-the-insurgent-power-of-the-commons]]
    - Alternative: urlencoding
        - %20 and such
        - cons:
            - in a non latin script (like cyrillic)
        - pros:
            - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3987 / IRIs
    - Alternative: remain with slugs for most URLs, but preserve full query information in a query parameter
        - /free-fair-and-alive?q="Free, Fair and Alive"
        - [[agora search]]
            - you want a GET method -> /search?q=what%20you%20want
            - redirects to the above
         - [[go/whatever you want here]]
             - -> anagora.org/whatever-you-want-here?q=whatever%20you%20want%20here
    - Are [[IRIs]] not working in browsers? they seem to mostly work nowadays?
    - input: https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Заглавная_страница
    - output:
        - [[firefox]] https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0
        - [[chromium]] https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0
            - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=405823 says they implemented IRIs
        - [[safari]], [[opera]] https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Заглавная_страница
    - [[IRIs]]: why are they not more widely supported?
    - urllib.parse.quote_plus(s):
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html
        - 'hello world' -> 'hello+world'
    - [[punycode]]
        - ü -> tda (transliterated as ue)
        - α -> mxa (alpha? alf?)
        - 'To prevent hyphens in non-international domain names from triggering a Punycode decoding, the string xn-- is prepended to Punycode sequences in internationalized domain names. This is called ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding). Thus the domain name "bücher.tld" would be represented in ASCII as "xn--bcher-kva.tld"'.
- Syntax ambiguities:
    - @syntax
    - URLs
        - [[https://example.com/somewhere else]]
        - https://example.com/somewhere else
    - [[go/somewhere else]] same thing
    - with urlencoded canonical nodes, [[https://example.com/somewhere else]] -> [[https://example.com/somewhere else]]
    - https://anagora.org/https://example.com/somewhere-else <- broken lib
    - if we urlencoded, that would be: https://anagora.org/https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsomewhere+else -- which still doesn't work, although I'm surprised about it
- [[x/y]] in [[mycorrhiza]] and [[agora]] behaves very differently
    - but it seems like we could easily make them compatible
- [[infinitely nested hyphae]]
    - a cool idea
        - filaments in [[mycelium]]
    - [[sibling hyphae]]
        - implemented in the sidebar
        - design mistake (maybe, in hindsight)
        - this encouraged a certain user behaviour, where top level hyphae are category-like
        - taxonomy / folksonomy
        - the platonic problem of ontology
        - [[banana]]: a [[tree]] and a [[fruit]]. where does it go?
        - This happens:
            - We have a hypha called ‘keyboard/microsoft ergonomic 4000’
            - Then we link it: [[keyboard/microsoft ergonomic 4000]]
            - We don't like how it looks in the resulting text, so we change the displayed text:
            - [[keyboard/microsoft ergonomic 4000 | microsoft ergonomic 4000]]
            - you mean: [[microsoft ergonomic 4000]]
            - you could say: [[microsoft ergonomic 4000]] ~ [[keyboard/microsoft ergonomic 4000]]
        - in the Agora you could write [[microsoft ergonomic 4000]] and because the node view is actually always a collection / search results list (in a way), you would get [[keyboard/microsoft ergonomic 4000]] 
        - [[1]], [[2]], [[3]]
        - new model (talking about events that are 6 months old or so) in mycorrhiza is more graph like
- [[strugatsky brothers]]
- https://melanocarpa.lesarbr.es/hypha/quadrat_48
- https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/blob/master/static/shortcuts.js
- https://github.com/madrobby/zepto [[zepto]] is a drop-in replacement for [[jquery]]

    - [[rakhil]] is cooler sounding -- agree completely

    - [[melanocarpa]] is meant to be coherent :)
    - [[cyberrachel]] is more bullet point based [[киберрахиль]] (kiberraxil)
    - [[optimistic linking]] comes natural to us
        - but too many red links can have downsides?

    - the tldr: [[pkm]] is a fad, actually has a great componet of [[status signaling]]

- [[ukraine war]]
    - :(
- [[nazi harassment]] in the [[fediverse]]
    - :(
    - [[blocklist]] thread you might be interested in: https://social.coop/web/statuses/107784596903671329
    - [[idea]] could the [[agora]] or something like it help people agree on blocklists more dynamically, effectively, compassionately?
- New meeting time?
    - This one's a keeper
    - Then for [[Pacific time]] it could be:
        - [[saturday afternoon]]
            - perhaps not great because it might interfere with personal life more often? but it could work
        - [[sunday afternoon]]
            - perhaps not great because it's almost monday and that is a bit depressing sometimes? but it could be uplifting :)
        - [[wednesday afternoon]]
            - could be cool, in particular when [[flancian]] takes wednesdays off!
    - #push [[do]]
        - we could do a [[matrix poll]]?
        - and/or [[mastodon]]/[[twitter]]?
        - this reminds us of the idea about setting up a [[consolidated polling platform]] that 'fans out' to different platforms that support polling and 'collects' responses
- How does everyone like jitsi vs something else (not google meet)
    - [[big blue button]] would probably be top alternative: [[go/meet]] points to [[bbb]]

        - [[rick tarosi]] :)
            - a [[mondegreen]] of [[rick turoczy]]
- [[vera]]
    - didn't get much done since last time; dealing with life
    - planning on making commit to [[agora-api]] to handle 
        - git file change stuff 
            - ostensibly this will accept a POST/PUT request to api with user/node/data combo and then write changes to disk and then create a git commit with those changes and push to gitea server using users logged in credentials
        - oauth integration
            - I don't like the way that [[gitea]] handles oauth login from mastodon, you have to hard code each allowed host manually which I'm not a fan of. There are plenty of mastodon api apps that let you sign in via any mastodon server, I'm tempted to create our own oauth layer that talks to gitea behind the scenes
                - we *could* go back to last year's plan w.r.t. using [[moa]] for this: [[go/moa/git]].
                - essentially add a [[git]] or [[gitea]] connector on top of twitter/mastodon
                - we could also open a ticket with gitea to ask about supporting arbitrary mastodon instances
        - adding text editor to agora website for logged in users
            - planning on using [[tinyMCE]] might use something else depending
            - this will talk to the code in agora-api that I mentioned above on submit
- [[flancian]]
    - same here! :)
    - my goal is to just go through the todo list I built last week :)
    - [[agora bot matrix]]
    - also [[fix gitea]] (certificate)
    - look into [[git lfs]]
    - #push [[sign in button]]
        - just add a sign in button :)
        - by default it redirects to a 'non implemented yet' page with a description :)
        - perhaps then it only lets you sign in with [[mastodon]], then we add others
    - look into [[moa]] auth code


# #push [[flancia-meet-2022-02-19]]
- attending [[vera]], [[bouncepaw]], [[flancian]], [[will]], [[neil]]
- building on the [[stoa]]
- [[vera]]
    - [[git write flow]]
    - [[agora api]]
    - [[gitea oauth]]
    - we will commit to user repos if they are logged in
    - [[flancian]] happy to work on this with you if you need anything
    - [[flancian]] perhaps we could release the oauth sign in first?
    - once we have this, we could finally start dumping social data for users if they want it
    - you get your own personal data store
    - is [[logseq]] doing this?
      - they used to, but apparently this is now removed or at least not front and center
      - they may or may not use [[git]] for their planned hosting, actually we should check with them
- [[ranking]] in the agora
  - reddit-style upvoting?
  - action called uprank
    - e.g. #uprank [[@username]]
  - could do it in the stoa
  - stoa could be a log, like an action log
    - various actions could be available
    - works like a replay log
  - e.g. [[marx]] should autopull [[karl marx]]
    - could have a persistent pull button, so next time agora knows to pull it
  - e.g. like RT on Twitter started as a user text based action that twitter then codified?
  - stoa can provide a nice meta layer on top of people's digital gardens
    - e.g. use pull in the stoa without having to use it in own garden
  - it would work on trust on people not gaming the stoa
    - trust based systems can be a good thing
    - e.g. look at problems of trustless blockchain projects
    - if instances are kept small, this is OK
- [[flancian]] has been thinking about [[browse as]]
  - related to concepts of [[liquid democracy]]
  - could be a way of 'previewing' what it might be like before delegating something to someone else
  - also relates to curation which is currently undervalued in social media
  - lets you burst out of [[filter bubble]]
- agora stoa is fully open...
  - moderation policy needed
  - anyone can edit stoa, what if e.g. end up with fascist subnode
  - difference between authentication and authorization
    - ‘authentication is boolean, authorization is a list of permissions’ — [[vera]]
  - could possibly have two stoas? one open to public, one more limited to agora users
  - [[semi-permeable membrane]] in reference to commons.  some boundaries are OK (needed in fact) to not ruin a commons.
  - [[reddy2go]] said we need [[bouncers]] and [[buddhas]] in communities
    - bouncers repel violence
    - buddhas try to foster community
    - [[neil]] likes the model of federation in mastodon -- you have a local timeline, and you can prioritize trusted instances you federate with -- but there's always the federated timeline, and also you have blocklists
      - e.g. poa.st and social.coop
      - [[blockchain]] was a [[common blocklist]] project but didn't seem actively maintained
      - [[weirder earth]]
          - has a well maintained list but it seemed to have potential for false positives
      - [[will]] going back to [[browse as]], you could have the concept of adopting someone else's blocklist to trial it/help debug
      - fascist vs shitposter
- building "consensus" and group decision-making
    - proposal and asking if anybody strongly disagrees
    - [[zebras]] are experimenting with ~five types of governance tools
    - consensus vs. consent
    - upranking as a case study
- [[agora bot]]
- [[upranking]]
  - if you uprank something in your garden, maybe that means 'send it above me'
  - or you might be saying that these two subnodes are related
    - one is a comment or annotation of another?
    - push to subnode?
    - possible distinction between garden, stream, comment nodes
      - relates to agora.yaml
  - or perhaps it could be a star or a bookmark
  - relative ranking is important
  - [[neil]] liked how [[ctzn]] did it -- you could apply any action to any resource
      - it could include emojis, but also arbitrary text comments that worked somewhat as [[tags]]
      - you could then perhaps choose to 'show me this node ranked by this particular user-defined ranking'
  - [[neil]] takeaway: let's go into the [[stoa]] and start adding relationships between subnodes
      - which actions, relationships, ranking of things will be converge on?
      - [[vera]] one thing we can do: write down which one we uprank/like and *why*
- [[metanode]] or [[supernode]]
  - a local graph of nodes/subnodes (where the link may not just be that they are defined by a shared title)
  - e.g. random/6
- compatibility with [[mycomarkup]]?
    - [[vera]] right now the parser is outputting pandoc ast
    - [[bouncepaw]] thinking of working on a spec
    - [[melanocarpa]] is the garden
    - add an API for checking hypha existence

            - example of [[hypha]]: https://mycorrhiza.wiki/hypha/idea/dynamic_hyphae
        - rename [[wikilink]] to [[hyphalink]] discussion 3 months ago
            - brought up by [[neil]]
        - [[mycorrhiza]] has both page and hypha concepts:
            - a page has a URL -- it's a web view
                - https://mycorrhiza.wiki/recent-changes/20 -- a page, but not a hypha
            - a [[hypha]]
            - links are just called links -- they don't use [[hyphalink]] or [[wikilink]]
                - they say 'external link' or 'local link'
                - sounds similar to [[hyperlink]]
    - #push [[anchors]]
        - how to determine scope for a #push (open problem in an Agora, beyond [[agora protocol]] limited implementation)
        - heading/paragraph problem / [[anchoring]] problem
        - anchoring algorithms to deep link or transclude fragments of text from a note
            - could what [[hypothesis]] do be reused to be resilient to edits?
        - a special anchor element:
            - https://mycorrhiza.wiki/hypha/idea/anchor_element
            - need to fix something in mycorrhiza
        - it seems we could agree on how to generate anchor ids for blocks?
            - also, how to regenerate/update anchor ids on updates
            - https://github.com/flancian/agora-server/issues/38 discussion will be held here
        - example things that could work :)
            - me says:[[foo#bar]] 
            - me says:[[hypha/coop]] 
            - me says:[[go/hypha/coop]] 
            - me says:#pull [[hypha#coop]] 
            - me says:#pull [[hypha/coop]] 

## #push [[flancia-meet-2022-01-22]]
- here [[flancian]], [[bouncepaw]], [[neil]], [[will]]
- flag for [[esperanto]] on [[bouncepaw]]'s wall
- [[bouncepaw]] https://pad.riseup.net
- [[bouncepaw]] [[community wiki]]
    - [[push]] [[meatball wiki]]
        - http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/
        - [[bus stops]] http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/TourBusMap
        - you can add your wiki to the list
        - make sure it loops back to the beginning :)
        - like a webring
        - agora could have something similar for digital gardens
        - does anything have a tree rather than sequential?
        - tour bus stop does have multiple routes - and you can change stops
- [[rings]] and [[discovery]]
    - [[merveilles ring]] 
    - [[push]] [[indieweb webring]] 
        - https://indieweb.org/indiewebring
    - [[doubleloop]] [[my garden circles]]
        - organized manually
        - per area
- aspects of the [[anagora]]
    - [[doubleloop]] [[reader]]
    - [[flancian]] [[integrator]]
- [[agora search]] [[ranking]] - can work implicitly via [[push]] [[pull]]
  - [[push]] [[pull]] is a more forceful intent than links alone
- [[mycorrhiza wiki]] - works at a block content level
- [[ted nelson]] 
    - is [[push]] based transclusion an idea that nelson discussed?
    - ([[pull]] for sure)
    - [[bouncepaw]] read [[literary machines]]
    - [[xanadu]] - [[maggie appleton]] describes as a set of patterns that are succeeding rather than a failed software project
  - [[push]] inspired by [[pubsub]]
    - you watch for changes and then push this update out
    - pubsub topics map to agora nodes
    - with push you have no control over how it might be displayed on the other end
    - on the receiving end you could ack (or pull?) to specify how the push gets handled
    - [[doubleloop]] [[webmentions]] work like this -- the receiving side has control on how to handle/process
    - [[activity pub]] inbox/outbox model
      ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/ActivityPub-tutorial-image.png)
- [[tags]] and [[wikilinks]]
  - wiki history - [[category pages]]
    - no tags, just link CategoryProfile instead of having hashtag #profile
    - reference/inclusion dichotomy
  - [[flancian]] could just push 100 pages
  - what does [[fedwiki]] do in relation to this?
- [[browsing styles]]
  - [[push]] [[cartographist]]
      - [[browser]] https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist
  - [[push]] [[gingko]] 
      - https://gingkoapp.com/
      - https://gingkowriter.com/
  - [[cortex]] browser
  - original browser from [[tim berners lee]] - each new page was a new window
    - related to interest in [[spatial software]] now, e.g. [[miro]]
  - original [[netscape browser]] had backlinks, but via a central server
    - we have similar services now, but none are built-in to browsers, e/g https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker
- [[federated wikis]]
    - [[bouncepaw]] federation is an extension of the core idea of [[interwiki linking]]
    - [[flancian]] is interwiki linking a type of federation?
    - [[bouncepaw]] don´t think so as interwiki linking doesn´t request any data of the target
    - do you know of protocols to federate wiki apart from [[fedwiki]]?
        - [[massive wiki]] and [[agora]]
        - [[mycoverse]] will be a federation of [[mycorrhiza]] servers (fungi) plus traditional websites (plants!)
    - [[mycomarkup]] can be generated from websites
      - same for [[markdown]]
      - see https://github.com/mozilla/readability
    - [[project underlay]]
- should we have [[mycorrhiza]] as a [[stoa]]?
- [[push]] [[authentication]]
    - [[oauth]]
        - [[single sign on]] -- could sites that trust each other share oauth credentials?
        - Turned out to be complex for [[mycorrhiza]]: https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/issues/74
        > It may look simple from the surface, but there might be some hidden gotchas that'll ruin the whole security model.
    - [[indieauth]] https://indieauth.net/ https://indieauth.com
    - [[solid project]] https://solidproject.org
    - [[telegram]] has an authentication service

        - simple API
        - supported by [[mycorrhiza]]: https://mycorrhiza.wiki/help/en/telegram

- [[oembed]] 
    - [[open graph]] is widely used for link previews in social media
