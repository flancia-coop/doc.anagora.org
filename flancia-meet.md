# Flancia Meet
- We meet best-effort every Saturday.
- This is where we could have community maintained notes :)

# #push [[flancia-meet-2022-02-19]]
- attending [[vera]], [[bouncepaw]], [[flancian]], [[will]], [[neil]]
- building on the [[stoa]]
- [[vera]]
    - [[git write flow]]
    - [[agora api]]
    - [[gitea oauth]]
    - we will commit to user repos if they are logged in
    - [[flancian]] happy to work on this with you if you need anything
    - [[flancian]] perhaps we could release the oauth sign in first?
    - once we have this, we could finally start dumping social data for users if they want it
    - you get there own personal data store
    - is [[logseq]] doing this?
      - they used to, but apparently this is now removed or at least not front and center
      - they may or may not use [[git]] for their planned hosting, actually we should check with them
- [[ranking]]
  - reddit-style upvoting?
  - action called uprank
    - e.g. #uprank plus username
    - could do it in the stoa
   - stoa could be a log, like an action log
   - various actions could be available
   - e.g. [[marx]] should autopull [[karl marx]]
     - could have a persistent pull button, so next time agora knows to pull it
     - works like a replay log
- [[agora bot]]
-

  - [[disco]] as a lefty use of blockchain governance structures
- [[libertarian socialism]]

## #push [[flancia-meet-2022-01-29]]
- attending: [[bouncepaw]] [[flancian]] (9AM) and [[vera]] joined later
- will probably do another one of these later in the day
- [[bouncepaw]] issue with deep linking into a particular instance of these meetings notes
    - [[push]] can be a solution (see above)
    - could also have a button with 'create stoa' that does node + timestamp concat (for example)
        - [[community wiki]] meets: https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiMeet
        - [[alex schroeder]] is the creator of:
            - [[emacswiki]]
            - [[community wiki]]
            - he also hates bots: https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2022-01-24_The_fediverse_doing_previews_for_the_CO₂_god
        - [[mycorrhiza]] now has a 5s delay load in [[robots.txt]]
            - https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/blob/master/static/robots.txt#L27
            - #push [[do]]
                - add robots.txt delay
        - #push [[hypha]]: not [[hyphas]] but [[hyphae]]
            - https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypha
            - https://mycorrhiza.wiki/help/en/hypha#Hypha_names
            - example of [[hypha]]: https://mycorrhiza.wiki/hypha/idea/dynamic_hyphae
        - rename [[wikilink]] to [[hyphalink]] discussion 3 months ago
            - brought up by [[neil]]
        - [[mycorrhiza]] has both page and hypha concepts:
            - a page has a URL -- it's a web view
                - https://mycorrhiza.wiki/recent-changes/20 -- a page, but not a hypha
            - a [[hypha]]
            - links are just called links -- they don't use [[hyphalink]] or [[wikilink]]
                - they say 'external link' or 'local link'
                - sounds similar to [[hyperlink]]
    - #push [[anchors]]
        - how to determine scope for a #push (open problem in an Agora, beyond [[agora protocol]] limited implementation)
        - heading/paragraph problem / [[anchoring]] problem
        - anchoring algorithms to deep link or transclude fragments of text from a note
            - could what [[hypothesis]] do be reused to be resilient to edits?
        - a special anchor element:
            - https://mycorrhiza.wiki/hypha/idea/anchor_element
            - need to fix something in mycorrhiza
        - it seems we could agree on how to generate anchor ids for blocks?
            - also, how to regenerate/update anchor ids on updates
            - https://github.com/flancian/agora-server/issues/38 discussion will be held here
        - example things that could work :)
            - me says:[[foo#bar]] 
            - me says:[[hypha/coop]] 
            - me says:[[go/hypha/coop]] 
            - me says:#pull [[hypha#coop]] 
            - me says:#pull [[hypha/coop]] 

## #push [[flancia-meet-2022-01-22]]
- here [[flancian]], [[bouncepaw]], [[neil]], [[will]]
- flag for [[esperanto]] on [[bouncepaw]]'s wall
- [[bouncepaw]] https://pad.riseup.net
- [[bouncepaw]] [[community wiki]]
    - [[push]] [[meatball wiki]]
        - http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/
        - [[bus stops]] http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/TourBusMap
        - you can add your wiki to the list
        - make sure it loops back to the beginning :)
        - like a webring
        - agora could have something similar for digital gardens
        - does anything have a tree rather than sequential?
        - tour bus stop does have multiple routes - and you can change stops
- [[rings]] and [[discovery]]
    - [[merveilles ring]] 
    - [[push]] [[indieweb webring]] 
        - https://indieweb.org/indiewebring
    - [[doubleloop]] [[my garden circles]]
        - organized manually
        - per area
- aspects of the [[anagora]]
    - [[doubleloop]] [[reader]]
    - [[flancian]] [[integrator]]
- [[agora search]] [[ranking]] - can work implicitly via [[push]] [[pull]]
  - [[push]] [[pull]] is a more forceful intent than links alone
- [[mycorrhiza wiki]] - works at a block content level
- [[ted nelson]] 
    - is [[push]] based transclusion an idea that nelson discussed?
    - ([[pull]] for sure)
    - [[bouncepaw]] read [[literary machines]]
    - [[xanadu]] - [[maggie appleton]] describes as a set of patterns that are succeeding rather than a failed software project
  - [[push]] inspired by [[pubsub]]
    - you watch for changes and then push this update out
    - pubsub topics map to agora nodes
    - with push you have no control over how it might be displayed on the other end
    - on the receiving end you could ack (or pull?) to specify how the push gets handled
    - [[doubleloop]] [[webmentions]] work like this -- the receiving side has control on how to handle/process
    - [[activity pub]] inbox/outbox model
      ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/ActivityPub-tutorial-image.png)
- [[tags]] and [[wikilinks]]
  - wiki history - [[category pages]]
    - no tags, just link CategoryProfile instead of having hashtag #profile
    - reference/inclusion dichotomy
  - [[flancian]] could just push 100 pages
  - what does [[fedwiki]] do in relation to this?
- [[browsing styles]]
  - [[push]] [[cartographist]]
      - [[browser]] https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist
  - [[push]] [[gingko]] 
      - https://gingkoapp.com/
      - https://gingkowriter.com/
  - [[cortex]] browser
  - original browser from [[tim berners lee]] - each new page was a new window
    - related to interest in [[spatial software]] now, e.g. [[miro]]
  - original [[netscape browser]] had backlinks, but via a central server
    - we have similar services now, but none are built-in to browsers, e/g https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker
- [[federated wikis]]
    - [[bouncepaw]] federation is an extension of the core idea of [[interwiki linking]]
    - [[flancian]] is interwiki linking a type of federation?
    - [[bouncepaw]] don´t think so as interwiki linking doesn´t request any data of the target
    - do you know of protocols to federate wiki apart from [[fedwiki]]?
        - [[massive wiki]] and [[agora]]
        - [[mycoverse]] will be a federation of [[mycorrhiza]] servers (fungi) plus traditional websites (plants!)
    - [[mycomarkup]] can be generated from websites
      - same for [[markdown]]
      - see https://github.com/mozilla/readability
    - [[project underlay]]
- should we have [[mycorrhiza]] as a [[stoa]]?
- [[push]] [[authentication]]
    - [[oauth]]
        - [[single sign on]] -- could sites that trust each other share oauth credentials?
        - Turned out to be complex for [[mycorrhiza]]: https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza/issues/74
        > It may look simple from the surface, but there might be some hidden gotchas that'll ruin the whole security model.
    - [[indieauth]] https://indieauth.net/ https://indieauth.com
    - [[solid project]] https://solidproject.org

- [[oembed]] 
    - [[open graph]] is widely used for link previews in social media
