# Flancia Meet
- We meet best-effort every Saturday.
- This is where we could have community maintained notes :)

## [[2022-01-22]]
- here [[flancian]], [[bouncepaw]], [[neil]], [[will]]
- flag for [[esperanto]] on [[bouncepaw]]'s wall
- [[bouncepaw]] https://pad.riseup.net
- [[bouncepaw]] [[community wiki]]
    - [[push]] [[meatball wiki]]
        - http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/
        - [[bus stops]] http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/TourBusMap
        - you can add your wiki to the list
        - make sure it loops back to the beginning :)
        - like a webring
        - agora could have something similar for digital gardens
        - does anything have a tree rather than sequential?
        - tour bus stop does have multiple routes - and you can change stops
- [[rings]] and [[discovery]]
    - [[merveilles ring]] 
    - [[push]] [[indieweb webring]] 
        - https://indieweb.org/indiewebring
    - [[doubleloop]] [[my garden circles]]
        - organized manually
        - per area
- aspects of the [[anagora]]
    - [[doubleloop]] [[reader]]
    - [[flancian]] [[integrator]]
- [[agora search]] [[ranking]] - can work implicitly via [[push]] [[pull]]
  - [[push]] [[pull]] is a more forceful intent than links alone
- [[mycorrhiza wiki]] - works at a block content level
- [[ted nelson]] 
    - is [[push]] based transclusion an idea that nelson discussed?
    - ([[pull]] for sure)
    - [[bouncepaw]] read [[literary machines]]
    - [[xanadu]]
  - [[push]] inspired by [[pubsub]]
    - you watch for changes and then push this update out
    - pubsub topics map to agora nodes
    - with push you have no control over how it might be displayed on the other end
    - on the receiving end you could ack (or pull?) to specify how the push gets handled
    - [[doubleloop]] [[webmentions]] work like this -- the receiving side has control on how to handle/process
    - [[activity pub]] inbox/outbox model
      ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/ActivityPub-tutorial-image.png)
  - [[tags]] and [[wikilinks]]
    - wiki history - [[category pages]]
      - no tags, just link CategoryProfile instead of having hashtag #profile
      - reference/inclusion dichotomy
    - [[flancian]] could just push 100 pages
    - what does [[fedwiki]] do in relation to this?
    - [[push]] [[cartographist]]
        - [[browser]] https://github.com/szymonkaliski/cartographist
    - [[push]] [[gingko]] 
        - https://gingkoapp.com/
    - [[cortex]] browser
    - original browser from [[tim berners lee]] - each new page was a new window
      - related to interest in [[spatial software]] now, e.g. [[miro]]
    - original [[netscape browser]] had backlinks, but via a central server
      - we have similar services now, but none are built-in to browsers, e/g https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker
- [[federated wikis]]
    - [[bouncepaw]] federation is an extension of the core idea of [[interwiki linking]]
    - [[flancian]] is interwiki linking a type of federation?
    - [[bouncepaw]] don´t think so as interwiki linking doesn´t request any data of the target
    - do you know of protocols to federate wiki apart from [[fedwiki]]?
        - [[massive wiki]] and [[agora]]
        - [[mycoverse]] will be a federation of [[mycorrhiza]] servers (fungi) plus traditional websites (plants!)
