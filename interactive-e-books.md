Interactive e-books are a type of digital publication that allow for a more engaging and dynamic reading experience than traditional e-books. They often include multimedia elements such as videos, audio, animations, and interactive quizzes or games. These features can help to illustrate concepts and keep readers engaged in the material. Interactive e-books can be found on a variety of platforms, including websites, apps, and e-bookstores. Some examples of interactive e-books include textbooks that include interactive simulations, children's books that include animations and games, and cookbooks that include video demonstrations.

Interactive e-books can be created using a variety of tools and platforms, such as Apple's iBooks Author, which allows users to create interactive e-books for the iPad and Mac. Other tools include Adobe Digital Editions, Kindle Textbook Creator and Kotobee.

It's worth noting that, Interactive e-books can be more resource-intensive than traditional e-books, and may require a stable internet connection to access all the features. Also, they may not be as widely supported as traditional e-books, so it's important to check the compatibility of the e-book with the device or app you plan to use before purchasing.
