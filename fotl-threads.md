# Welcome to [[FOTL]] threads!

This document is meant to capture high level discussion [[threads]] we want to pursue in the [[fellowship of the link]] meetings.

Usually threads will be seeded in live discussion and transported here from [[fellowship of the link]] or [[fotl]] meeting minutes.

## Schemas
- from [[2022-10-26]]
    - [[people]] [[tools]] [[techniques]]
        - #map [[goals]] maybe as a separate category, or [[intent]]
        - maybe also [[audience]]

## Integration
- from [[2022-10-26]]
    - [[flancian]] have been meaning to collect a list of repositories which we would like integrate into a shared construct (agora wink wink) -- do you have any?
        - [[peter kaminski]] massive wiki is agnostic w.r.t. versioning and sharing models (or tries to be)
            - for git, [[massive wiki]] can have submodules
            - [[massive wiki builder]] will build
        - do you have note repositories of your own, personal or otherwise?
            - [[peter kaminski]] have one but not currently shareable :)
            - AI: suggest we keep discussing this in future instances
                - [[sister sites]], sister pages
                - twin pages
                - interwiki
                - web rings :)
                - wiki [[collaboration primitives]]
                - Instant wikilinks / cascading wikisheets: implicit interwiki resolution (a la https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/InstantCommons) :: make the local .cws legible so you can see the order in which your current interface looks for matching nodes in choosing the default interwiki 
                    - try variation that chooses cascade order based on length/quality of target node
                    - try interface variation that shows top N options in asymmetric list/pie
                - [[fedwiki]] is brilliant but the feeling of the room is that we don't fully understand it
                    - is there people building any kind of business providing fedwiki widely/easily?
