    - I've been thinking of configuring [[oauth]] in our [[hedgedoc]] (this has been somewhere in my todo list for a while) to be able to "just" log into hedgedoc to add subnodes.
    - But I also need to test [[vera]]'s workflow to make direct subnode editing in the Agora work. This is blocking on moving my primary [[garden repository]] to [[gitea]], I think?
