# Bonfire + Social.coop
- Attending: [[Ivan Minutillo]], [[Mayel de Borniol]], [[Flancian]]
- Intros
    - Ivan: a user of social.coop but not very active so far
    - Previously discussed with [[Eduardo Mercovich]] how social.coop could advance their experiment w.r.t. bonfire
- Flacian: a year ago we set up a test instance: http://bonfire.social.coop/ 
- maybe we could use it as Loomio replacement or complement (like the meta space for members to discuss the co-op)?
- could use SSO to log in which we have set up
- this would start as a local-users-only instance (without federation)
