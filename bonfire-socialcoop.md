# Bonfire + Social.coop
- Attending: [[Ivan Minutillo]], [[Mayel de Borniol]], [[Flancian]]
- Intros
    - Ivan: a user of social.coop but not very active so far
    - Previously discussed with [[Eduardo Mercovich]] how social.coop could advance their experiment w.r.t. bonfire
- Flacian: a year ago we set up a test instance: http://bonfire.social.coop/ 
- maybe we could use it as Loomio replacement or complement (like the meta space for members to discuss the co-op)?
- could use SSO to log in which we have set up
- this would start as a local-users-only instance (without federation turned on) or at least ability to limit polls to members only
- the local-only approach would make sense also for the bonfire project
    - 'accepted answer' which was developed for the open science project (interesting) could also benefit social.coop
    - there's also reactions in the works
    - the [[decision making]] extension would be more sophisticated than polls
        - [[ukuvota]]: ukuvota.world, ukuvota.xyz
    - Q: would someone in social.coop be interested in helping build these features together?
        - facets: design and ux; coding
        - a researcher with experience in the social aspects as well would be great
        - last year a group of edumerco's students worked on the decision making extension for bonfire; they did prototyping based on some user research.
        - whoever picks this up could take the above prototype and run with it
