[DemocracyOS](https://anagora.org/democracyos "[[DemocracyOS]]")Â is an open-source platform for deliberative democracy that aims to empower citizens to participate in the political decision-making process. It was founded in 2012 by Pia Mancini and Santiago Siri, who were looking for a way to make politics more transparent, participatory, and accountable.

The platform uses a combination of online and offline tools to facilitate deliberation, debate, and voting on policy issues. It includes features such as a discussion forum, a voting system, and a collaborative drafting tool for policy proposals. The goal is to give citizens a greater voice in the political process, while also promoting more informed and deliberative decision-making.

One interesting aspect of DemocracyOS is its focus on transparency and accountability. The platform is designed to be fully transparent, with all discussions, votes, and policy proposals visible to the public. This helps to promote trust and accountability in the political process, as citizens can see exactly how decisions are being made and who is making them.

Another interesting feature of DemocracyOS is its use of deliberative democracy principles. Deliberative democracy is a form of democracy that emphasizes the importance of deliberation and discussion in the decision-making process. By encouraging citizens to engage in thoughtful and informed discussions about policy issues, DemocracyOS hopes to promote more informed and nuanced decision-making.

DemocracyOS has been used in a variety of contexts, from local government to political parties to international organizations. It has been used to facilitate deliberation and voting on policy issues ranging from education reform to climate change to economic policy.
