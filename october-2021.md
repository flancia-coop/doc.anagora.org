- i feel like October is going to be good. i want to work on the graph visualization for the site and [[agora ext]]
- I'm working on using sqlite as a data cache for performance and meta storage. There is a branch in my agora server forked repo
- [[flancian]] and I started work on [[agora api]]

- I also feel like October is going to be good. I think I'm getting somewhere in my fight with [[procrastination]], and in making sense of the path ahead of us -- it is already to a degree encoded in the Agota, but it needs to be rationalized, edited and scheduled.
- In October I want us to ship the following [[agora]] features:
    - [[stoa]]
        - Hedgedocs with working wikilinks.
        - Personalized hedgedocs: you press + and you get a document belonging to the user you're browsing as (perhaps marked as untrusted until the user with the matching username 'acks').
        - Auto pull stoa when there's content in it.
            - Requires solving [[stoa grabs focus]]
    - [[agora server]]
        - "browse as"
        - [[auto push]], meaning for example this item would be auto pushed to node [[agora server]] as it's a child of a bare mention of [[agora server]]
    - [[agora api]]
        - ship repo api
            - what's the next action here? probably testing it. [[vera]], perhaps we should write down some curl invocations in README.md as way of documenting the API? is there a better way?
        - add first write path use case -- [[agora social media integration]] is a top candidate, [[personalized hedgedocs]] could be another
- [[write]]
