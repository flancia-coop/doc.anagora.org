The Systems View of Life presents a unified systemic framework that integrates the biological, cognitive, social and ecological dimensions of life.

It shifts from a mechanistic view of life to one where life is seen as a network of relationships and cognition is part of life processes.

Autopoiesis is a major foundation, where living systems continually recreate themselves while preserving their pattern of organization.

Cognition is the process of self-generation and self-perpetuation of living networks, not just something the brain does.

The book provides a needed historical perspective on science and shows physics alone is insufficient to describe life's patterns.

It integrates developments from the last few decades of science beyond Fritjof's previous works.

The book examines order, complexity and shifts from mechanistic to complex systems thinking.

It defines spirituality separately from religion and integrates human values.

Sustainability, interconnected problems, and potential solutions around energy, climate and agriculture are discussed.

The book aims to help the transition to a sustainable future embracing qualitative growth and a richer understanding of life.



The book "The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision" by Fritjof Capra & Pier Luigi Luisi is divided into four main parts:

I. The Mechanistic Worldview
This section explores the historical development of the mechanistic view of the universe, life, and society. It examines the Newtonian world-machine, the mechanistic view of life including cellular and molecular biology, as well as its implications for medicine. It also delves into mechanistic social thought, covering the origins of social sciences, political economy, and the role of Cartesian economics[1].

II. The Rise of Systems Thinking
This part transitions to the emergence of systems thinking as a response to the limitations of mechanistic views. It covers the shift from understanding the world in terms of its individual parts to appreciating the whole as more than the sum of its parts. Topics include the emergence of systems thinking, the new physics, classical systems theories like tektology, general systems theory, cybernetics, and complexity theory, highlighting principles of nonlinear dynamics and fractal geometry[2].

III. A New Conception of Life
Here, the authors present a new understanding of life as an integrated, systemic phenomenon. They discuss what characterizes living systems, the concept of autopoiesis, interactions with the environment, and the implications for understanding social systems and cognition. This section also encompasses the complexity of the living world, the evolution of species, the search for the origin of life on Earth, human evolutionary history, the nature of mind and consciousness, the intersection of science and spirituality, and the systems view of health and healthcare[3].

IV. Sustaining the Web of Life
The final section discusses the ecological dimension of life and the need for systemic solutions to global environmental and societal issues. It covers the principles of ecology, the interconnectedness of worldwide problems, the illusion of perpetual growth, and the networks of global capitalism. The authors call for systemic solutions that are sustainable, touching on topics such as energy, climate change, agroecology, and the role of design in sustaining life on Earth[4].

This structure reflects the book's progression from the critique of mechanistic thought to the emergence of systems thinking and its applications to life, society, and the sustaining of the global ecosystem.
