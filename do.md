I think I'm going to start using the stoa in [[do]] to keep my top level todo list -- or at least my [[inbox]]. Unfortunately [[do]] the node is overloaded, and this is very convenient as I can just edit it in any browser :) Feel free to do the same if it helps! (I'll likely soon add one doc per user in the Agora.)

# flancian
- write [[building bridges]]
- code [[agora bridge]]
  - [x] [[agora bot replies to wikilinks from followers]]
  - [x] [[agora bot links wikilinked posts from followers]]
  - [ ] [[agora bot stores messages for users]]
- code [[auto pull]]
  - perhaps base it on inline transclusion like wikipedia/url pulls
- code [[auto push]]
  - [[foo]]
      - foo gets this line auto pushed because it's a wikilinked parent of a block (as defined by indentation or user set syntax)
- see [[do]] [[later]] :)
