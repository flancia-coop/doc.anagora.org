"Lady Burup" is most likely a reference to the [[Burrup Peninsula]], which is located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The peninsula is home to the oldest known examples of rock art in the world, some of which are estimated to be over 40,000 years old. The area is also home to a significant amount of biodiversity, including several species that are found nowhere else in the world. The peninsula is of great cultural significance to the local Indigenous Australian communities, who have been living in the area for thousands of years. The name "Lady Burup" may have been given to the peninsula in honor of Lady Edeline Sackville, who was the wife of the Governor of Western Australia in the early 20th century.
