- should we combine #moderation-questions and #reports
    - moderation questions is unlocked, and could conceivably be for philosophical questions and abstract scenarios
    - reports is locked and is about specific actions of specific people
- let's do the loomio vote for new CWG members

Attendees
- Melissa
- Gilles
- Steve
- Matt
- (a late) Calix

Dan had a conflict, but is fine being on the moderator rotation wherever we need him
Django can't do working hours meetings or moderation, settling in to new job (just to be aware)

KeyCloak instance is our future happiness for SSO - it is what we use for the wiki
is deployed using co-op cloud 

next meeting:
- Calix, can we meet an hour earlier or later
- let's try an hour later next month - AGREED 2/20 18:00 UTC

calendaring:
- google calendar not updating from next cloud as expected (should update every 12 hours), annoying for getting this meetings
- have some ideas for making this work

Bonfire
- we have a test/experimental social.coop bonfire instance
- TWG wants CWG to manage memberships and moderation
- we don't have any access or documentation on how to do either of those
- need to make it abundantly clear that this is test server/not our main offering
- may want to direct to an open instance, if such exists
- if we do want to moderate, we need to have a plan for what the limits are and how to enforce them
