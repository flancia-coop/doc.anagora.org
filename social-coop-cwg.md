- (a late) Calix

Dan had a conflict, but is fine being on the moderator rotation wherever we need him
Django can't do working hours meetings or moderation, settling in to new job (just to be aware)

KeyCloak instance is our future happiness for SSO - it is what we use for the wiki
is deployed using co-op cloud 

next meeting:
- Calix, can we meet an hour earlier or later
- let's try an hour later next month - AGREED 2/20 18:00 UTC

calendaring:
- google calendar not updating from next cloud as expected (should update every 12 hours), annoying for getting this meetings
- have some ideas for making this work

Feb 2 - 
Feb 9 - 
Feb 16 - 
Feb 23 -
