Collaborative filtering (CF) is a technique used by recommender systems.[1] Collaborative filtering has two senses, a narrow one and a more general one.[2]

In the newer, narrower sense, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person. For example, a collaborative filtering recommendation system for preferences in television programming could make predictions about which television show a user should like given a partial list of that user's tastes (likes or dislikes).[3] Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but use information gleaned from many users. This differs from the simpler approach of giving an average (non-specific) score for each item of interest, for example based on its number of votes.
