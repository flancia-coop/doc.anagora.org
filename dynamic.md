- Notes from a meeting with [[dynamic]] a.k.a. [[alex]].
    - About [[Fediverse]] culture, governance and other topics.
    - Came from [[cyber.space]], which had a different approach to governance.
    - On the topic of blocking (or not) [[mastodon.social]]
    - Came to [[social.coop]] because of very good interactions with people here, having read also people here.
    - Initially imagined social.coop to be more selective/more centered around coops proper.
    - Very interested in [[consensus governance]], used to live in coop housing. It was very good for a bit.
- Mix of backgrounds in social.coop
    - People who are interested in coop aspects or in governance in particular
    - People who are really into sociocracy
    - People who like the financial/ownership model
- On the discussion around Threads.net
    - https://www.loomio.com/d/AZcJK6y2/discussion-support-the-anti-meta-fedi-pact/162
    - Facilitated a different thread
    - Process was a bit gruelling and surfaced a lot of difference in values
    - Consensus-type decision making at the scale of social.coop is hard
        - Branching should be easier, should not be a big deal
    - Desire to participate in the coop further went down after threads.net discussion, in particular after criticism from a particular individual
- On conservative vs liberal in this particular context
    - 'xenophobia' comment
    - [[promiscuous federation]]
- Working groups
