Samuel Klein says:love your naming scheme!
Samuel Klein says:this diagram also suggests scale-free design [which is compelling; not privileging zoomed-in or z
oomed-out parts of the whole]
Samuel Klein says:++
Peter Kaminski says:Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python
Peter Kaminski says:
Jerry Michalski says:is that like agreeing on a hashtag?
Samuel Klein says:One thing I'd like to see more easily is the list of repositories in your agora, and which ones h
ave a node for a given wikilink
Samuel Klein says:I have to run!  This was great to see, worth tuning to a 15-min pitch
Samuel Klein says:‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
Samuel Klein says:oho my next meeting was moved back I have 15 min üòÉ
Jerry Michalski says:yay!
Jerry Michalski says:it's a hypertext catfish!
Aram Zucker-Scharff says:I found this very useful! I have to drop
Jerry Michalski says:see you!
Peter Kaminski says:
Samuel Klein says:there's probably room a tool like "full auto-linker" that could look through your doc + its conte

node-graph, &c]
Samuel Klein says:and the list of stoas could itself be more compact, so "list of stoas" and "list of nodes" could
each be ~infoboxes taking up 1/3 to 1/2 of the top couple inches of a standard screen
Samuel Klein says:Agora Mask
Jerry Michalski says:how might Michael make Factr Agora-fluent?
Jerry Michalski says:our recording is about to konk out (I think)
Jerry Michalski says:ah, it went right past the hour and is still recording. oh, well üòÉ
Samuel Klein says:"seamlessly connect concepts [and variants] across different notebooks and wikis"
