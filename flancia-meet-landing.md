# Flancia meet

[[go/flancia-meet]]

Flancia Meet is a weekly video conference where we discuss our projects and goals, and occasionally work in public. Most participants are programmers.

We meet on Saturdays. Usually around 11 UTC.

We have a Matrix chat: [[go/agora-discuss]].

## Values
* **No FOMO.** It's fine to miss these meetings and join sometimes. Sometimes nobody shows up. It's fine.
* **No stress.** It's voluntary and supposed to be fun. It is OK to skip often, or indeed always.
* **We try to practice Loving Kindness and the Principle of Charity** when interacting with each other and with people outside the group.
* **Flancia** values apply. See https://flancia.org.
