# Social.coop Tech Working Group Roadmap: 2024

## Objective
To define high level goals for the Tech Working Group of Social.Coop to explore during 2024, and request review/comment from the wider community.

## Meta
- See https://anagora.org/twg for other resources associated with the #TWG, or search for that hashtag in the social.coop instance.
- Consider joining the [TWG](https://matrix.to/#/#socialcoop-tech:matrix.org) or [Open](https://matrix.to/#/#SocialCoop:matrix.org) chat rooms in our Social.Coop Matrix Space.

## Projects

These are the next steps we have identified for currently running projects.

- Wiki next steps
   - Pretty stable/usable.
- SSO next steps
   - Backup/restore of users
   - Keeping users in sync with other sources we have currently:
       - loomio
       - social.coop instance (Mastodon)
- Mastodon next steps (main instance)
   - Move to Hometown: yay or nay?
- Bonfire next steps (for a second instance)
   - Configure SSO (Mayel sent a build to try)
   - Test federation fixes once they're there
- We need to exercise backup/restores in general
   - [[Flancian]] tested backups for the wiki, restores come next :)
