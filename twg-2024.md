# Social.Coop Tech Working Group 2024 Roadmap

## Objective
To define high level goals for the Tech Working Group of Social.Coop to explore during 2024, and request review/comment from the wider community.

## Meta
- See https://anagora.org/twg for other resources associated with the #TWG, or search for that hashtag in the social.coop instance.
- Consider joining the [TWG](https://matrix.to/#/#socialcoop-tech:matrix.org) or [Open](https://matrix.to/#/#SocialCoop:matrix.org) chat rooms in our Social.Coop Matrix Space.

## Projects

These are projects currently being run by the Tech Working Group, together with high level next steps we have identified for them. They are in priority order:

- wiki.social.coop
   - Moved to [[mediawiki]] running on top of [[coop cloud]] during 2023.
   - Next steps:
       - Pretty stable/usable as of the time of writing.
- SSO
   - auth.social.coop now exists, running on top of [[keycloak]] on [[coop cloud]].
   - Next steps:
       - Backup/restore of users
       - Keeping users in sync with other sources we have currently:
           - loomio
           - social.coop instance (Mastodon)
- Nextcloud with SSO
    - Or a calendar-only service with SSO
    - Would make recurring coordination of social.coop events much more inclusive
- Mastodon (main instance)
   - Many upgrades took place, and we moved to a new server :)
   - Next steps:
       - Move to Hometown: yay or nay?
- Bonfire (for a second instance)
   - bonfire.social.coop nominally up for experimental usage.
   - Next steps:
       - Configure SSO (Mayel sent a build to try)
       - Test federation fixes once they're there
- Monitoring and alerting
    - Monitor further items in datadog
    - Or adopt a free monitoring platform (which?)
    - Items we need to make sure we cover:
        - Basic uptime monitoring
        - Instance latency and errors
- General
    - [[Flancian]] tested backups for the wiki, restores come next :)
    - Convergence between [[ansible]]-based and [[coop cloud]]-based infrastructure might be desirable in the future, but better bang-for-the-buck might be found elsewhere.
    - [[Bots]]:
        - Help [[ntnsndr]] host his bot
        - Run [[boost bot]] for the community, in particular the CWG would like to [[boost introductions]]
       
## Other topics of interest
- Organizing circle participation might yield a steady stream of feedback from other working groups.
- The recurring domain name ownership issue is being tackled by the FWG.
