# Social.coop Tech Working Group Roadmap: 2024

## Objective
To define high level goals for the Tech Working Group of Social.Coop to explore during 2024, and request review/comment from the wider community.

## Meta
- See https://anagora.org/twg for other resources associated with the #TWG, or search for that hashtag in the social.coop instance.
- Consider joining the [TWG](https://matrix.to/#/#socialcoop-tech:matrix.org) or [Open](https://matrix.to/#/#SocialCoop:matrix.org) chat rooms in our Social.Coop Matrix Space.

## Current status

These are projects currently being run by the Tech Working Group, together with high level next steps we have identified for them.

- wiki.social.coop
   - Moved to [[mediawiki]] running on top of [[coop cloud]] during 2023.
   - Next steps:
       - Pretty stable/usable as of the time of writing.
- SSO
   - auth.social.coop now exists, running on top of [[keycloak]] on [[coop cloud]].
   - Next steps:
       - Backup/restore of users
       - Keeping users in sync with other sources we have currently:
           - loomio
           - social.coop instance (Mastodon)
- Mastodon (main instance)
    
   - Move to Hometown: yay or nay?
- Bonfire (for a second instance)
   - au
   - Configure SSO (Mayel sent a build to try)
   - Test federation fixes once they're there
- We need to exercise backup/restores in general
   - [[Flancian]] tested backups for the wiki, restores come next :)
