The following was generated by the Agora AI and it's pretty much completely wrong but in a funny way:

> "Tare tuttare ture" is a phrase that comes from the Conlang (constructed language) movement, specifically from the language Esperanto. It is a humorous phrase that does not have a direct translation to English, but it is often used to initiate a conversation or to break the ice.

In Esperanto, "tare" is an interjection used to get someone's attention, similar to "hey" or "hello" in English. "Tuttare" is a made-up verb that means "to greet everyone" or "to say hello to everyone." "Ture" is another made-up word that is used to confirm or agree with what someone has said, similar to "true" or "right" in English.

So, when someone says "tare tuttare ture" in Esperanto, they are essentially saying "hello everyone, that's right" or "hey there, I agree." It's a playful and inclusive way to start a conversation, and it's a great example of the creativity and community spirit of the Esperanto language and its speakers.
