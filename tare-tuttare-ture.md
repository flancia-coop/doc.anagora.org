The following was generated by the Agora AI and it's pretty much completely wrong but in a funny way:

> "Tare tuttare ture" is a phrase that comes from the Conlang (constructed language) movement, specifically from the language Esperanto. It is a humorous phrase that does not have a direct translation to English, but it is often used to initiate a conversation or to break the ice.

> In Esperanto, "tare" is an interjection used to get someone's attention, similar to "hey" or "hello" in English. "Tuttare" is a made-up verb that means "to greet everyone" or "to say hello to everyone." "Ture" is another made-up word that is used to confirm or agree with what someone has said, similar to "true" or "right" in English.

> So, when someone says "tare tuttare ture" in Esperanto, they are essentially saying "hello everyone, that's right" or "hey there, I agree." It's a playful and inclusive way to start a conversation, and it's a great example of the creativity and community spirit of the Esperanto language and its speakers.
