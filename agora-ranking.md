RFC: how do you think we should treat ranking in this Agora, in particular as it grows?

^ agree 

I think it should be configurable per user.  Either by a config setting in each user's garden, or on the client side.

Different sort/rank configuration options: 

- random
- order of creation
- upvotes

I'm generally wary of liking/upvote mechanisms, but they are probably OK.  So long as they avoid gamification/addiction.

Not sure about putting uprank data within nodes themselves - it seems like metadata?  I'm not sure I would do it, as my notes exist outside of this agora, too.
