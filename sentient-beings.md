Sentient beings are creatures with the capacity to experience feelings, perceptions, and consciousness. This term is often used to describe animals with advanced cognitive abilities, including mammals, birds, and some reptiles and fish. However, the definition of sentient beings can vary, and some philosophers and researchers argue that certain invertebrates, such as octopuses and some insects, may also possess sentience.   
In the [Agora of Flancia](https://anagora.org/agora%20of%20flancia), the concept of sentient beings is closely related to the topic of [animal welfare](https://anagora.org/animal%20welfare) and [ethics](https://anagora.org/ethics). Many people believe that sentient beings have inherent value and moral significance, and that we have a moral obligation to treat them with respect and compassion. This perspective is often associated with the animal rights movement and the idea that non-human animals have basic rights, such as the right to life and freedom from suffering.   
The concept of sentient beings is also relevant to the study of [artificial intelligence](https://anagora.org/artificial%20intelligence) and [robotics](https://anagora.org/robotics). Some researchers are exploring the possibility of creating machines that are capable of experiencing emotions, consciousness, and other aspects of sentience. This raises complex ethical and philosophical questions about the nature of consciousness, the definition of sentience, and the moral status of artificial beings.
