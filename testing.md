> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Branch Renaming Notice (Effective 2025-09-15)**
>
> Agora projects will migrate their default branch from `master` to `main` on or after **September, 2025**, to align with modern Git standards.
>
> Agora Server was already migrated earlier. If you are in a master branch after the time of migration and you see no changes, please migrate to main as per the following instructions.
>
> While GitHub will automatically redirect web links, this change requires this one-time update for any local clones.
>
> Please run the following commands to update your local repository:
>
> ```bash
> # Switch to your local master branch
> git checkout master
>
> # Rename it to main
> git branch -m master main
>
> # Fetch the latest changes from the remote
> git fetch
>
> # Point your new main branch to the remote main branch
> git branch -u origin/main main
>
> # (Optional) Clean up old remote tracking branch
> git remote prune origin
> ```
>
> Thank you for your understanding as we keep the Agora aligned with current best practices!

into a distributed knowledge graph.

For an example Agora, and for more information on the Agora design, please refer to <https://flancia.org/go/agora>.
