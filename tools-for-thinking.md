# Mathew's notes on Revive conference: Gordon Brander demos Subconscious
## Context 
* see [RENDER: Tools For Thinking conference](https://myhub.ai/items/render-tools-for-thinking-conference)
* I'm using different note-taking tools to scribe  different conference sessions - this Hedgedoc was automatically created by [[flancian]]'s [[an agora]] [page for the conference](https://anagora.org/tools+for+thinking)
* The idea we have in the [[Fellowship of the Link]] is that all the notes by all the scribes are somehow interlinked in a shared second brain, hence the wikilinks in these notes
* I've been enjoying [[Gordon Brander]]'s enewsletter for a while, so I'm really looking forward to his demo. I'm way behind properly processing his content, tho - everything I LikeThinkDo tagged [[Gordon Brander]]: https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=gordon+brander
* I'm looking to riff off this in search of insights meaningful to me as I explore this space, write a chapter in [[Ivo Velithckov]]'s book on Personal Knowledge Graphs, and develop my ideas for [myhub.ai](myhub.ai)
## Noosphere: worldwide PKG

### What would it take to make the internet a useful thinking tool?
Sensemaking crisis during planetwide crisis.
We didnt get a global brain from the internet because "apps trap thoughts" - caused by fundamental internet architectural idea: "same origin security model": each app its own Universe.
Needed: protocol for thoughts.
### what is Noosphere: 
* Open source project, cofunded by mozilla and ipfs.
* Ambition: create low-level p2p infrastructure, like http
* decentralised over [[ifps]]
* priotises user ownership, yet multiplayer
* belongs to everyone: you can do whatever you want

### what does it do
* local first file sync
* change hilstory a la git
* cross-app transclusions & backlinks
* user-owned data backpack - take your data with you
* self-soverign social graph - you own what you put into it
* lots of copies to keep stuff safe (content addressing)

**Layering onto [[ipfs]]:**
* human friendly names for ipfs hashtags:
* versioning
* signing with UCAN-authorized key

**@sphere/path:**
* @sphere is your username, derefernces into a public key
* paths point to memos:
    * generic protocol
    * ipfs meta envelope: header + body (pointer to a ipfs file) + parent (pointer to previous version, hence version control)
    * any filetype
    * [[UCAN]] signed: cryptographic protocol
        * authorises data management
        * self-sovereign security model: you own your keys, your identity, take it with you
            * works with wallets and passkey paradigm

**Sphere servers**
* personal ipfs gateway
* bridges to web
* synch with personal devides

## Myhub and Noosphere?
Hugely interesting. Possibly too ambitious for me.
Out of the box he's including following
