# Mathew's notes on Revive conference: Gordon Brander demos Subconscious
## Context: 
* see [RENDER: Tools For Thinking conference](https://myhub.ai/items/render-tools-for-thinking-conference)
* I'm using different note-taking tools to scribe  different conference sessions - this Hedgedoc was automatically created by [[flancian]]'s [[an agora]] [page for the conference](https://anagora.org/tools+for+thinking)
* The idea we have in the [[Fellowship of the Link]] is that all the notes by all the scribes are somehow interlinked in a shared second brain, hence the wikilinks in these notes
* I've been enjoying [[Gordon Brander]]'s enewsletter for a while, so I'm really looking forward to his demo. Everything I LikeThinkDo tagged [[Gordon Brander]]: https://myhub.ai/@mathewlowry/?tags=gordon+brander
