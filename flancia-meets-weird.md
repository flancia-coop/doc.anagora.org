- Attending: [[zicklag]] [[bouncepaw]] [[flancian]] 
- Greetings!
    - [[Zicklag]] it looks like we're doing similar stuff/playing with similar things.
    - [[Flancian]] looking forward as well!
    - [[Bouncepaw]] +1, let's start with intros
- Check ins
    - [[bouncepaw]]: computer science student in Russia, finishing a degree soon; golang dev, switching jobs in a week. Doing open source for some time. Two projects: [[mycorrhiza]] and [[betula]], we can discuss them later.
    - [[Zicklag]]: been coding since I was 10 :) it runs in the family; dad is DBA/cloud architect/devops, learnt some stuff from him. With brother been exploring making video games. Met [[Erland]] in the Rust community, was playing with [[Haxe]] prior and moved to Rust for safety.
        - [[Fish folk]] jumpy game
            - Made own engine!
        - Was then looking for something closer to a job :)
            - Interested in community building.
            - Discord server approach is maybe a risk, as you can "lose" a community if you get kicked out
        - Links page generator
            - Local first, take back your data
                - Side note: 
                    - [[twitter community archive]] by [[ex genesis]] is in a related space
                    - [[moa]] and bridging
            - Akin to [[carrd]] to and [[link tree]]? 
            - [[Weird]] wants to [[bring back personal websites]]
                - Side note: [[indieweb]] seems maybe related/affine
                - Want to make it very easy: sign up and you get a subdomain, you can choose which domain.
            - More domains in pockets
                - Could then also facilitate making use of your own domain in new ways, e.g. get a bluesky user based on your domain
                - Would like to make it so that you can replicate all your data using your browser only
                    - Q: with local storage? some other arch?
                    - P2P
            - We want to [[bring back user agency]] by making it easy enough for normal people.
                - Side note: know of some projects like [[sutty]] which are in a similar space.
- [[Weird one]]
- [[Mycoverse]]
- [[Agora]]
