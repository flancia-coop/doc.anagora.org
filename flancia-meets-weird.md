- Attending: [[zicklag]] [[bouncepaw]] [[flancian]] 
- Greetings!
    - [[Zicklag]] it looks like we're doing similar stuff/playing with similar things.
    - [[Flancian]] looking forward as well!
    - [[Bouncepaw]] +1, let's start with intros
- Check ins
    - [[bouncepaw]]: computer science student in Russia, finishing a degree soon; golang dev, switching jobs in a week. Doing open source for some time. Two projects: [[mycorrhiza]] and [[betula]], we can discuss them later.
    - [[Zicklag]]: been coding since I was 10 :) it runs in the family; dad is DBA/cloud architect/devops, learnt some stuff from him. With brother been exploring making video games. Met [[Erland]] in the Rust community, was playing with [[Haxe]] prior and moved to Rust for safety.
        - [[Fish folk]] jumpy game
            - Made own engine!
        - Was then looking for something closer to a job :)
            - Interested in community building.
            - Discord server approach is maybe a risk, as you can "lose" a community if you get kicked out
        - Links page generator
            - Local first, take back your data
                - Side note: 
                    - [[twitter community archive]] by [[ex genesis]] is in a related space
                    - [[moa]] and bridging
            - Akin to [[carrd]] to and [[link tree]]? 
            - [[Weird]] wants to [[bring back personal websites]]
                - Side note: [[indieweb]] seems maybe related/affine
                    - [[Zicklag]]: seen on the side but not totally got deep in it, would like to integrate as much as possible. Indieweb culture seems very developer-oriented.
                    - +1. I know [[Chris Aldrich]] who is a proponent/could be intereting to meet.
                    - Next iteration of [[web rings]] in this space.
                - Want to make it very easy: sign up and you get a subdomain, you can choose which domain.
            - More domains in pockets
                - Could then also facilitate making use of your own domain in new ways, e.g. get a bluesky user based on your domain
                - Would like to make it so that you can replicate all your data using your browser only
                    - Q: with local storage? some other arch?
                    - IndexDB plus P2P using WASM
            - We want to [[bring back user agency]] by making it easy enough for normal people.
                - Side note: know of some projects like [[sutty]] which are in a similar space.
            - Q: is money still a motivator/topic?
                - A: yes; we're planning on charging something like ~$50/y to unlock custom domains and some other features.
                - Storage requirements also drive that, e.g. through the [[leaf]] protocol (sp?)
                - Q: do you know the prices of your competitors, e.g. linktree?
                    - A: good question.
            - Planning connectors so people can bring their data from other platforms.
                - \o/
                - intermediate data format
                    - [[leaf]] everything has a schema and a spec
                        - similar to rdf, or to atproto's lexikon
                        - rdf was too granular
                        - atproto is object-oriented-like
                        - leaf is in the middle, tries to compose many items that are small and each have a class (mixin like)
            - Hoping for an MVP by the end of December
                - almost there with billing
                - web designer helping out
            - [[Leaf]] grew out organically out of our requirements
        - Q: what is weird? :) 
            - A: depends on the audience.
            - A0: weird is the easiest way of having a personal website.
            - A1: it's an offline data store with synchronization, and a way to publish websites from it.
                - all the data is eventually consistent and can be sync'd p2p
                    - [[willow]] defines the minimum semantics necessary to get synchronization to work
                        - https://willowprotocol.org/more/compare/index.html
                    - [[loro.dev]] might be integrated in the future, it's a [[crdt]]
                - side notes:
                    - ipfs?
                    - [[fission]] ~ fission.codes tried to build something similar but folded recently
            - A2: it's the previous plus it has a social aspect, indexing/cross-linking layer
            - Weird is [[open source]]; there's a non-commercial license on the web app.
        - Q: do you know about [[solid]] by [[tbl]]?
            - A: a little bit but we haven't delved into the tech.
                - Have heard: RDF can be heavyweight. It also seemed very "enterprise focused".
                - [[bouncepaw]]: tried to understand it with their specification and failed; activitypub spec is much better. Like the idea of pods though.
- [[Mycoverse]]
    - [[Mycomarkup]] -- a [[markup language]]
    - [[Mycorrhiza]] -- a [[wiki engine]], close to what I call classic wiki engines
        - has [[interwiki]] capabilities, but it's not considered “federated”
    - [[Betula]] is federated link manager
        - Q: so this is server based and published with activitypub?
            - A: yes.
    - Was thinking of how to integrate with [[weird]]
        - Could use weird as database/storage
        - Weird could consume betula streams
        - Zicklag: facets in atproto and the link to e.g. supporting multiple markup languages.
        - [[block protocol]]
        - intermediate representations
        - [[standoff annotations]] related to [[facets]]: https://scalingsynthesis.com/standoff-annotation/
            - seems related to [[xanadu]]
                - which also yielded e.g. [[transclusion]]
