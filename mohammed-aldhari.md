Hello my friend! Here you can write what you want. It's a public
my name is Mohammed is from Yemen 
thank you flancia ❤
flancia is my house now 
I find myself in flancia after years in loss 
thank you flancia ❤
My plan and my dream is
learning.  To learn English fluently and also to study web front-end design.
I have already studied an introduction to html and css and an insufficient introduction to javascript 😅.
I have already studied an introduction to html and css and an insufficient introduction to javascript 😅
I am getting ready to travel to India to study there
And also to look for a chance to survive 
my passport now in Indian Embassy in Djibouti.

I am the father of 3 children
I will leave my family here in Yemen inside dirty war 💔
because Because I don't have any other choice right now
Their travel costs are very expensive.
It is not possible to leave for a country where it is possible to find a job
So I will leave them to the mercy of war
I may find an opportunity to apply for asylum.  Or maybe get a work visa.  Or maybe I can get a job online through which I can live in India, Egypt or Jordan.
If I had long term support I would have taken them with me.
I will try with all my might.  I will fight.  I will pray to succeed
no hope here in Yemen. Every day the events are mounting and increasing murder.
I will work hard.  I wish you were with me.  Save me and my family from fear and destruction.
Thank you, flancia , for giving me this great opportunity.  that I never dreamed of.
flancia You are the greatest person on earth
thank you 

I may not be able to prove my suffering.  But I am honest.  Maybe the poor are always liars and crooks in the eyes of the rich .
Pain breaks me and makes me bend down and speak with fear and caution.
