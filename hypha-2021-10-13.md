- [[benhylau]]
    - (we've met before)
    - interested in alternate forms to [[web rings]] that are more distributed, going beyond
    - how can we 

## Agora
- nodes are entities
    - just text; a freeform text label
- [[pubsub]] topics
    - publish anything by publishing canonical wikilink

- global presence, out of social media into the web as a holistic concept

## Solidarity
- [[merveilles]] town web ring is a nice example of a web ring
    - https://webring.xxiivv.com/

    - webring as just the presentation layer
    - curated experience through a community
    - [[knowledge futures group]]
        - [[metasj]] 
        - [[underlay project]]
- [[udit]] web rings 
    - one concern with the distributed approach: high level of curation needed
    - see web rings as an onramp
    - would like to make sure they work with [[distributed press]]
- webrings with a purpose
    - examples:
        - webring of wealthy individuals willing to contribute to UBI

    - gamify them
    - democratically controlled
    - more inclusive so people can participate
        - [[accessibility]]
    - people submitting to moderation queue

## UBI
- current projects
    - https://joincircles.net/
    - https://www.gooddollar.org/
    - wealthy individuals giving directly
        - [[effective altruism]]
- potential projects
- are there better ways to do similar things?
- [[udit]] some concerns over whether it could backfire and end up preserving existing power structures
    - [[vera]] if we have UBI it needs to be decentralized / not nation based
- [[flancian]] how do we help/solve the problem of matching people with interesting projects in this space?
    - [[udit]] it is a very large problem, economics as a field tries to tackle solving coordination/matching problems
    - [[vera]] we need to have problems be defined and contextualized by the people that are suffering them
    - is there a generic structure that could aid in the quest to find solutions to people's problems?
    - [[vera]] UBI seems like the most efficient path forward
- [[effective altruism]]
    - how to solve problems
    - internet freedom
    - I have time/resources where do I go? What do I do?
