- The Agora tries to provide something useful to the user in every page -- even in those with no content :)
- you should be able to depend on an Agora node always having:
    - A world writeable document, where I'm currently writing this.
    - A video conferencing room you can pull and start using without leaving the Agora.
- This makes it so that each node comes bootstrapped with the minimum collaboration tools you need to work with others on something.
