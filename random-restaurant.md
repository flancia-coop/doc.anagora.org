A "random restaurant" where you try bite-sized combinations of a few ingredients, e.g. bacon + broccoli + toasted bread + mayonnaise + honey. You don’t have to eat every single combination generated. If it sounds bad, just turn it down. This restaurant would be more like a lab – you would be in all likelihood trying it for the first time. If there are a hundred ingredients and each course is five ingredients together, then there are 75 million+ possible combinations.
