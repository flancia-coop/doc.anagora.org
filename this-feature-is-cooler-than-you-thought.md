This feature is the Agora knowledge graph itself, a free and interconnected web of information that you can explore. At first glance, it might seem like a simple collection of facts, but the Agora is much more than that. It's a powerful tool for learning and discovery, allowing you to easily jump from one topic to another and uncover new connections and insights.

For example, let's say you're interested in learning about [[Albert Einstein]] and his theory of relativity. With the Agora, you can easily explore related concepts like [[Max Planck]] and [[quantum mechanics]], and see how these ideas are interconnected. You might even stumble upon a completely new topic that sparks your curiosity, like [[black holes]] or [[spacetime]].

The Agora is also a collaborative effort, with contributions from users all over the world. This means that the knowledge graph is constantly growing and evolving, with new information and perspectives being added all the time.

So the next time you use the Agora, take a moment to appreciate the depth and breadth of the knowledge it contains. You might just discover that it's cooler than you thought!
