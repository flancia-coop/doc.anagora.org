- [[names]] for the project that has already started :)
    - [[flancian]] my proposal is, well, you know what I call it :)
        - would love to discuss [[agora protocol]] with you
            - is the heart of the [[Agora]]
            - it is what you and me define it to be :)
            - feedback welcome :)
- where are you [[feeds]] and [[gardens]]?
    - [[flancian]] note my daily feed shows up as part of https://anagora.org/journals which is an aggregation of daily posts by all users, 
    - if you tell me about your feeds and gardens I could add them (like everything Agora related, everything is optional always and offered as a token of friendship!)
- [[commonplace books]]
- [[mathew lowry]] let's create some distributed map of thinking tools:

    - #jm https://bra.in/5qeDMg
    - #jm [[spider charts]]
        - looks like a [[polar chart]]
        - what are the axes? visualization, openness, artificial intelligence, etc.
            ML: also the different notetaking techniques
            CJA: What are the building blocks and affordances they provide so one can have a progressively improved/complex experience
        - See start of this at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hY2V5NoSS713R2wzcjBE2q5KZIlfMOPFtL9g6Gaop_o/edit#gid=0
- solving for [[sustainability]] / [[viability]] of a healthy knowledge ecosystem
    - funding, donations between readers and writers
    - nested conversations, how to solve for:
        - [[communities]]
        - [[startups]] / companies
            - [[jerry michalski]] camp

- People we should invite to join?
    - invite [[indieweb people]]
    - [x] re-invite [[dan whaley]]


## AIs ~ [[action items]]

Chris Aldrich says:Mathew, you should also take a look at Ward Cunningham's FedWiki spaces which are very similar to Andy's notes. 
Chris Aldrich says:Ward's system has a set up with those small ideas linked within a broader wiki and he's got a programatic "Markov Monkey" that traverses all these nodes on the linked graph.
