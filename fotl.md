- [[names]] for the project that has already started :)
    - [[flancian]] my proposal is, well, you know what I call it :)
        - would love to discuss [[agora protocol]] with you
            - is the heart of the [[Agora]]
            - it is what you and me define it to be :)
            - feedback welcome :)
- where are you [[feeds]] and [[gardens]]?
    - [[flancian]] note my daily feed shows up as part of https://anagora.org/journals which is an aggregation of daily posts by all users, 
    - if you tell me about your feeds and gardens I could add them (like everything Agora related, everything is optional always and offered as a token of friendship!)
- [[commonplace books]]
- [[mathew lowry]] let's create some distributed map of thinking tools:

### Notes
- Where to track a recurring agenda/our goals?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] something that has worked for indieweb is having people who join show a token of interest; e.g. try to improve something for someone
        - i.e. we can talk all day, but improvements to real systems are what we should be shooting towards
        - we could focus here on integrating systems that already exist (the ones we're building or fostering individually) as a group
    - [[flancian]] let's try to spot patterns (...)
- [[aram zucker-scharff]]
    - works for the [[The Washington Post]]
    - developed [[pressforward]], a tool for [[wordpress]]- http://pressforward.org/
    - building easy to use websites, archives -- in a way that allows them to interact with each other
        - https://context.center/
        - https://github.com/AramZS/contexter
        - https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-pages/
    - [Aram on the Fediverse](https://indieweb.social/@Chronotope) 
    - interested in solving [[misinformation]] and [[archival]]
    - for note taking, [[markdown]] on [[git]]
        - [[flancian]] https://anagora.org
- [[fellowship of the link]], a crowdsourced introduction :)
    - [[zettelkasten]], [[commonplace books]], [[tools for thought]], [[personal knowledge graphs]], [[interlays]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] lots of projects in this space are trying to sell something; but we care most about the [[commons]]
    - how do we take idea capturing and generating and link them into a healthy [[knowledge commons]]?
- [[logseq]] model as it relates to the commons
    - taking VC money seems slightly worrying as they'll want to be repayed
    - https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
    - [[logseq]] looks close to [[obsidian]]
        - do we have enough variety of approaches?
    - paying for services is fine
- [[you need a wiki]]
- [[agenda]]
    - #push [[rel8]]
        - https://wiki.rel8.dev
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[rel8 pioneers]]
    - [[flancian]] let's all push our projects onto a shared space and talk by default about interlinking and integrating them?
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] let's start a list of resources and repositories? 
        - this may help to bootstrap a [[commons]]
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[mycelium]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[liberating voices pattern language]]
        - [[1 2 4 all]] ~ [[one two four all]]
- [[bouncepaw]]
    - [[mycorrhiza]]
    - [[hypha]]
- [[flancian]] let's build an [[agora]]? :)
    - this seems to be what we're trying to achieve this, regardless of the name?
- let's bring to the next meeting -- a list of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- [[affordances]]
    - [[wikilinks]] and [[metadata]] as key to the [[commons]]
- [[meta]] about chat
    - let's prefer the [[mattermost]] to [[jitsi chat]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] what's the difference between [[indieweb]] vs [[fediverse]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is a subset of [[indieweb]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[indieweb]] is based around the notion of having your own website and building your identity around it
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is based around the notion of your identity being hosted in an instance like [[mastodon.social]]
 
 - Let's discuss what we wrote to [[rel8]], our lists of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- People who need access to the repo (github usernames):
    - flancian
    - aramzs
    - bouncepaw
    - chrisaldrich
    - mathewlowry
- Let's talk about [[search engines]]
    - https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/2022-07-02-projviding-meaningful-search-results-without-own-index.html 
    - [[queries as addresses]]
- Phone service vs Internet service analogy: https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
- Let's onboard everybody to the [[fediverse]]!
    - [[mastodon]] app is actually good to bootstrap/choose an instance
- Dump your ActivityPub IDs here ;)
    - @flancian@social.coop
    - @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com
    - @bouncepaw@lor.sh 
- What do we see as our long term goal?
    - [[flancian]] let's integrate repositories and tools and write [[science fiction]] together :) how could our tools, platforms, the internet, the world at large look like by [[2025]], [[2030]]?
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] is focusing on producing the [[pkg book]] chapter and would love to do research and writing in this space
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] would like to participate in exploration and prototyping; illustrate and broadcast interesting ideas for others to pick up; analyze what it will take to deliver this by the next decade; organize activities
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] appreciate the idea of [[shared wikis]] that can communicate back and forth with each other
        - [[flancian]] we should invite [[ward cunningham]]!
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] history of the medium
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[songlines: the power and promise]] 
            - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[third archive]]

### Notes
- [[Jerry Michalski]] 
    - #push [[rel8]] 
        - #go https://www.rel8.dev
            - (a [[google site]])
            - https://www.rel8.dev/wiki is embedded above
        - "relating ideas, documents, perspectives and people"
    - (Jerry is using [[obsidian]] plus [[obsidian sync]] for this)
    - [[short term]], [[medium term]] and [[long term]] goals for [[rel8]]
    - [[short term]]
        - define: how do we share notes?
        - import [[jerry's brain]] from [[json]] into [[obsidian]] and [[excalidraw]]
            - [[Zsolt VicziÃ¡n]] (https://www.zsolt.blog/) is interested in doing this
        - what do we put on [[rel8]]?
            - a list of formats/processes that are sufficient for us to 'store our brain' comfortably?
            - [[Mathew Lowry]] user requirements exercise
        - [[flancian]] on a hub architecture for integrating brains and negotiating exchange (format conversion)
            - [[underlay]], [[interlay]], [[overlay]] as per [[metasj]]
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] decentralized or centralized?
            - decentralized is the idea (or distributed)
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] what should we be using as way of standards to create this?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] text -> markdown -> html
            - (shared by default is convenient but can be problematic)
            - text as the basic standard
            - then add links, e.g. markdown or org mode
            - then html, microformats, json, yaml can be layered on top
            - exchanged p2p (distributed) or via hubs
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] interested on web mentions, fediverse as they exist in the data exchange ecosystem
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] how can you design a minimum building block that is interoperable with other pieces?
            - [[web mentions]] takes the older ideas of pingback/trackback, strips them down to the essentials. it's a notification system via [[post]] requests.
            - [[mastodon]] could support web mentions (there was talk about this a few years back)
            - if X writes a post about URL A by Y, Y will be pinged
            - Y receives the notification, can do some spot checks (does the call refer to a post that actually has the expected link), and then does whatever it wants with it
            - [[activitypub]] could take advantage of [[webmentions]] as a building block, but it mostly doesn't
                - [[kevin marks]] (sp?) added microformats to [[mastodon]]
       - [[flancian]] decentralized vs distributed approach, web3 and all
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] technical details vs ease of use
       - [[flancian]] two directions we could go in:
           - text as the standard makes it easy to use actually as users can write text wherever they want, a priori
           - focusing on making existing tools and ecosystems easier to use/onboard to
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - high tech skills: you set up your own mastodon instance, agora, etc.
           - medium: you produce information, content but someone else pays the [[admin tax]] (you contribute to an instance)
           - (spectrum)
           - no technical expertise
           - #push [[blot im]] is very useful, imports from whenever you want
               - [[flancian]] nice, and it's open source: https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot
               - wanted to do this for the Agora so this is super helpful
       - [[Mathew Lowry]]
           - who are we building this for?
           - "instagram user" might be too wide a net?
           - disconnect from building a knowledge graph and writing for others
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
       - #push [[nuggets, remedies and pov]]
           - [[nuggetization]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related
       - [[public]] vs [[private]] as a default
           - [[public]] as default seems better to seemingly most of us
       - [[Chris Aldrich]] mostly these days notes start in [[hypothes.is]]
           - periodically gets feedback about how cool it is to work in public
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[fedwiki]]
           - [[twitter]] user 509 here (!)
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - going back to what we have in mind and where our ideas overlap
           - not really sure what he's expecting here, but a tool that would be interesting would be like this:
               - like the agora, where you could see it from two different perspectives
                   - as a personal tool, where an individual user decides which graphs converge on the agora
                   - "mix and match" feeds and gardens, an aggregator
                   - like an [[agora view]]
               - another agora is closer to anagora.org, where you push many graphs to a place but where the owners of the repos decided that in advance
           - an extension or tool could be written so that the nodes you see could be actual URLs, and incoming/outgoing links would be those around your internet context (social graph, feeds)
           - [[Jerry Michalski]]
               - [[apple's]] [[knowledge navigator]] video back in 1986
       - [[adversarial interoperability]]
           - [[Chris Aldrich]] For the [[adversarial interoperability]] fans: https://granary.io/
           - [[Mathew Lowry]] [[mysilio]]
       - [[myhub]]
           - writing aids to get from notes to defined outputs
       - [[having a somewhere]]
           - [[knowledge contexts]] as a service
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - [[writing toolkit]]
           - #push [[social reader]] tracks, breaks down and integrates feeds
               - #go https://indieweb.org/social_reader
           - https://indieweb.org/Microsub
           - [[micro.blog]] is great
           - [[refbacks]]
               - https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2QvtE9w5zs49x7WUeG8Ut1vywHDLiG2Wkm9p pinged his site
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
           - [[intimacy gradient]] is a pattern in [[a pattern language]]
           - [[the view master]]
               - how do we generalize and integrate the superpowers that each tool gives?
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - would like to highlight the link aspect of how information pieces relate to each other
           - which links are mentioned in that tweet, that post?
           - about the [[great fungus]]
               - still thinking of this as an individual app customized by the user
               - [[personalized fungus]]? [[fungus view]]
- [[minimum viable formats]]
    - text
    - diagrams
- [[goals]]
    - define our [[wheres]] (from [[having a somewhere]])
        - [[the big fungus]]
        - [[agora]]
    - define minimum viable formats for storing our brains

## 2022-06-09
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Inviting others
    - [[flancian]] been inviting people already, but would be like to use some kind of policy?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] suggest to use the Mattermost to coordinate; use this space to consider together our goals and attract others like this
       - [[mattermost]] https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-fellowship-of-the-link
    - let's use the list of people in the [[doc]] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAourQe_MKh0uWomLsS_V5ea3zm30g8paE49X56jIHs/edit
        - to brainstorm on who to invite if you want to discuss a priori
    - [[flancian]] invited Dan because of his interested in the space + his experience with web standards
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[web]] https://www.fellowshipofthelink.org/

        - christopherjaldrich@gmail.com
    - we could also start groups in social networks, e.g. linkedin
        - [[flancian]] [[mastodon]]?
        - got stuck in [[choosing an instance]]
            - [[diego de la hera]] mastodon.social could be seen as the default
            - (instance delegation could be interesting, web of trust like)
            - http://www.unmung.com/mastoview is a tool for helping to choose Mastondon instances
        - [[diego de la hera]] lack of defaults as a hindrance to adoption here, in the indieweb as well
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[barry schwartz]] https://bra.in/4jXVP2
            - [[the tyranny of choice]]
            - [[schelling point]]
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] with more choice you usually get increasing complexity
            - you are given so much choice it's almost too much (in the indieweb)
            - [[Jerry Michalski]] templates, walkthroughs add a lot of value
            - [[Chris Aldrich]] you need either a lot of time or people motivated because they're building business
            - [[peter kaminski]] introduced [[Jerry Michalski]] to [[obsidian]]
            - on straightforward vs powerful tools
            - [[diego de la hera]] on the power of forks

                - -> [[web annotations]]?
                - [[gyuri lajos]]
                    - **[[Jerry Michalski]] let's have a group sync with Gyuri?**
                    - [[Chris Aldrich]] trails are related to [[vannevar bush]]'s
        - wishlist for [[fotl]]: how do these parts fit together?
            - how do we make it so that our notes provide maximum utility, spread through the big fungus
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] would like to focus on how to
        - make it all work together
        - make the systems be easy to use
        - make something that is as simple to understand as facebook?
        - I'd like to see [[commonplace books]] that can "talk" to each other.
        - "the [[stream]] flows by too fast"
            - turning streams into gardens

- [[john borthwick]] at [[betaworks]] has funding for small projects [[think camp]]
- Watch parties
    - [[connection series]]
        - watch these, take notes/diagrams and share/interop
        - -> [[books, paintings, movies, ideas that shaped many people's lives]]
            - https://bra.in/5pxdW6
    - [[dan whaley]] youtube annotations are a side project / hobby
        - [[docdrop]] https://docdrop.org/
- [[diego de la hera]]
    - web annotations were mentioned; thought of two connections
        - [[peter hagen]] -> [[lindylearn]] https://lindylearn.io/ and specifically https://annotations.lindylearn.io/new/
            - social platform where you would find what other people are annotating and join the conversation
            - provides a discovery layer for what others are reading and thinking about
        - [[chrome]] is also tackling annotations
        - [[worldbrain]], [[memex]]?
        - it seems like here we want to work more on the level of how to connect different annotation tools at a (federated?) layer
            - perhaps what we need is an integration device at this layer, e.g. [[wikilinks]]

            - wishlist: [[open global mind]] platform instead

        - [[indieweb]] / https://indieweb.org
        - [[open web backup]], strong belief in owning your own domain, your own data, your own identity
        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[Jerry Michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space

    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
        - [[jerry]] +1 -- the big fungus is a metaphor for the result of this collaboration. But [[playnz]] might be an [[mvp]]/[[demo]] or just an experiment/playground for interoperability.
        - are these tools perhaps already playns?
            - they might be, yes.
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[progressive enhancement]] is key
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
            - how can we take all these tools and build an architecture that supports progressive enhancement?
            - we start with plain text as the base, then you can add things like markdown/html, then you add photos/media
        - [[flancian]] problems and opportunities:
            - exploring hub architecture vs full graph integration
            - lossiness as you interop through tools, playns
            - complexity of integrations

20:14
Peter Kaminski
Peter Kaminski says:"Familiar hypertext tools support calligraphic hypertext, hypertext that begins without links and lets the writer link things that should be connected. Storyspace 3 adds sculptural hypertext tools as well. Sculptural hypertext begins with densely linked bundles like decks of cards, from which the reader might select pages in any sequence. But Storyspace hypertexts arenât just random: writers can remove links and enforce constraints so the hypertext organizes itself. Sculptural hypertext encourages painterly narrative in which the writer controls what she knows to be necessary while relaxing control over the reader when control might not be needed."
