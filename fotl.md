    - https://www.politicalcompass.org/
    - Jury duty is per sortition; could public office work the same way?

    - [[debt: first five thousand years]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] two kinds of debt, one internal (to a community?) and the second of which is the more capitalist. The second has taken over all day to day functions.

- [[Chris Aldrich]] on The [[paradox of tolerance]] as it applies to late stage capitalism (it does not allow other forms of economy/allocation to coexist).
    - [[Bentley Davis]] maybe capitalism fears alternatives that imply its vanquishing/replacement.
    - off-topic link for Jerry and me (and whomeber else) later, ye olde youtube recommendation gave me this interesting-looking video:

"Turbo Compound Piston Engines. Almost magic tech. - YouTube"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMgwDIdScY


The first comment is an amazing and dense recollection:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbMgwDIdScY&lc=Ugzs7M838Khq1pNTFj94AaABAg
    - [[critiques of capitalism]] can work / be accepted; but the moment you talk about replacement, you get shut down with 'this is impossible'.
- [[Peter Kaminski]] question about the Agora and [[bonfire]]
- [[Bentley]] on the problem of [[capitalism]] as a word/label
    - Profit and profit-seeking in particular is not necessarily implied by the word
        - [[Profitism]] as an alternative for the buggy implementation we have now
        - [[Toxic capitalism]] which can devolve into [[Fascist Capitalism]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] the term didn't exist before Marx followers started using it
- On how to migrate systems
    - On the difficulty of upgrading complex systems in-place
    - Options:
        - model hard and try to do it piecemeal/locally
        - [[walkaway]] / [[omelas]] approach
        - ignore political lines / go by geographic criteria like watershed
        - by affinity of people/groups/neighborhoods/cities even at a distance (cities have more in common, etc.)
    - Moving from 'majority first' to 'enough people to solve a particular problem first'.
    - [[15%]] as the tip-off point for social change 
        - Where does this come from?
        - Maybe https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/the-tipping-point-when-minority-views-take-over/562307/

# [[2024-01-03]]
- [[peter kaminski]] [[flancian]] [[aram]] [[jerry]]
- [[plex dispatch]] https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/
- [[flancian]] Welcome to 2024!
    - Two changes today, that we might or might not choose to stick with:
        - Conference is in https://framatalk.org/fotl instead of https://meet.jit.si/fellowship-of-the-link.
        - Notes are at https://doc.anagora.org/fotl instead of https://doc.anagora.org/fellowship-of-the-link.
            - Maybe we could keep the same doc?
            - We might want to at least import all the history here?
    - Thoughts?
- [[jerry]] lots of calls in this beginning of [[2024]]
    - project: [[everyday]] -- a wiki-like collaboration environment
- [[peter kaminski]]
    - [[indieweb meetup]] took place in [[san diego]]
    - it was very cool, suggest you check out [[indieweb]] more if you haven't
    - (this is how [[aram]] found us)
    - cool tech, but the community is not much into diffusion/proselitization
    - can it be adopted easily?
        - [[indieauth]] could be -- indeed it seems like [[django]] is doing this
    - [[aram]]: on the [[bus factor]] of some of the projects
        - [[indielogin]] stopped working for Pete at some point
        - it's hard to tell how much of the common infrastructure they are building is sustainable/will still be around in a few years?
        - how hard would it be to re-bootstrap into e.g. [[indieweb2]]? 
    - [[webmentions]] -- can be saved with e.g. [[brid.gy]]
    - Q: who runs community infrastructure well?
        - does [[Mastodon]] provide examples?
            - individual instances go down, but the network remains
            - [[indieweb]] should be as resilient
            - can indieweb endpoints be redirected from multi-user-hosts to single-user if you go that way? do multi-user-hosts exist?
        - [[aram]] wants something more like [[nostr]]
        - on the issues of [[governance]] / scaling organizations involved in lowering bus factors
            - linked to [[training]] and [[documentation]]
            - on the issue of [[succession planning]]
            - [[hachyderm]] and [[krisnova]]
        - [[100 years site]] by [[automattic]]: https://wordpress.com/100-year/
        - on the advantages of [[static sites]] for long term storage
    - disagreements with [[long now]] foundation
        - [[aram]] will write something down about this :)
    - [[college media]]
- [[aram]] shares screen, hopefully :)
    - [[song obsessed]]: https://songobsessed.com/
        - #git https://github.com/AramZS/songobsessed
    - [[jerry]] https://www.liveplasma.com/

- #pull [[fellowship of the link]] 

## Scratch space
- #pull [[fellowship of the link]]
    - that has lots of actual notes for meetings, these are random chat logs and other items that we factored out for one reason or the other
    - (HedgeDoc used to be hitting note size limits, but not anymore).
- [[names]] for the project that has already started :)
    - [[flancian]] my proposal is, well, you know what I call it :)
        - would love to discuss [[agora protocol]] with you
            - is the heart of the [[Agora]]
            - it is what you and me define it to be :)
            - feedback welcome :)
- where are you [[feeds]] and [[gardens]]?
    - [[flancian]] note my daily feed shows up as part of https://anagora.org/journals which is an aggregation of daily posts by all users, 
    - if you tell me about your feeds and gardens I could add them (like everything Agora related, everything is optional always and offered as a token of friendship!)
- [[commonplace books]]
- [[mathew lowry]] let's create some distributed map of thinking tools: 
    - https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/78gprua18frkpc6shrxabricqo
    ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_888c6fbb5753be41ddb48290c35d505d.png)
    - #jm https://bra.in/5qeDMg
    - #jm [[spider charts]]
        - looks like a [[polar chart]]
        - what are the axes? visualization, openness, artificial intelligence, etc.
            ML: also the different notetaking techniques
            CJA: What are the building blocks and affordances they provide so one can have a progressively improved/complex experience
        - See start of this at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hY2V5NoSS713R2wzcjBE2q5KZIlfMOPFtL9g6Gaop_o/edit#gid=0
- solving for [[sustainability]] / [[viability]] of a healthy knowledge ecosystem
    - funding, donations between readers and writers
    - nested conversations, how to solve for:
        - [[communities]]
        - [[startups]] / companies
            - [[jerry michalski]] camp

- People we should invite to join?
    - invite [[indieweb people]]
    - [x] re-invite [[dan whaley]]


## AIs ~ [[action items]]
- AI(flancian): post about [[adversarial interoperability]] in [[ogm]]
- AI(flancian): add the following to the Agora as one of the search "providers" :)
    - [[chris aldrich]] https://twitter.com/search?q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Areplies&src=typed_query&f=live
- sync about approach / instructions for [[betaworks]] [[2022-08-16]] event
    - -> https://wiki.rel8.dev/scribing_tools_for_thinking
- AI(jerry michalski): give access to github repo?
- Create a survey about uses of tools for thought and note taking? 
    - (discussed [[2022-08-11]])

Peter Kaminski
Peter Kaminski says:"Familiar hypertext tools support calligraphic hypertext, hypertext that begins without links and lets the writer link things that should be connected. Storyspace 3 adds sculptural hypertext tools as well. Sculptural hypertext begins with densely linked bundles like decks of cards, from which the reader might select pages in any sequence. But Storyspace hypertexts aren’t just random: writers can remove links and enforce constraints so the hypertext organizes itself. Sculptural hypertext encourages painterly narrative in which the writer controls what she knows to be necessary while relaxing control over the reader when control might not be needed."
