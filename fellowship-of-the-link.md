- Attending: [[jerry michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[chris aldrich]]
- Inviting others
    - [[flancian]] been inviting people already, but would be like to use some kind of policy?
    - [[jerry michalski]] suggest to use the Mattermost to coordinate; use this space to consider together our goals and attract others like this
       - [[mattermost]] https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-fellowship-of-the-link
    - let's use the list of people in the [[doc]] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAourQe_MKh0uWomLsS_V5ea3zm30g8paE49X56jIHs/edit
        - to brainstorm on who to invite if you want to discuss a priori
    - [[flancian]] invited Dan because of his interested in the space + his experience with web standards
- [[jerry michalski]]
    - [[web]] https://www.fellowshipofthelink.org/
    - who wants admin? :)
        - 0@flancia.org
        - delahera@gmail.com
        - christopherjaldrich@gmail.com
    - we could also start groups in social networks, e.g. linkedin
        - [[flancian]] [[mastodon]]?
        - got stuck in [[choosing an instance]]
            - [[diego de la hera]] mastodon.social could be seen as the default
            - (instance delegation could be interesting, web of trust like)
            - http://www.unmung.com/mastoview is a tool for helping to choose Mastondon instances
        - [[diego de la hera]] lack of defaults as a hindrance to adoption here, in the indieweb as well
        - [[jerry michalski]] [[barry schwartz]] https://bra.in/4jXVP2
            - [[the tyranny of choice]]
            - [[schelling point]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] with more choice you usually get increasing complexity
            - you are given so much choice it's almost too much (in the indieweb)
            - [[jerry michalski]] templates, walkthroughs add a lot of value
            - [[chris aldrich]] you need either a lot of time or people motivated because they're building business
            - [[peter kaminski]] introduced [[jerry michalski]] to [[obsidian]]
            - on straightforward vs powerful tools
            - [[diego de la hera]] on the power of forks
                - e.g. [[chris aldrich]]'s setup is something we could fork to bootstrap a new user's environment
                - people have copy/pasted Chris's website already, full pages at a time :)
       - [[flancian]] [[map of the fediverse]]
- longer term goals / brainstorming / dream sharing
    - [[jerry michalski]]
        - series of projects revolving around these issues
            - [[open global mind]], started 2y ago
                - part of a [[flotilla]] with other organizations
                - 8am pacific, standing call for [[ogm]]
            - [[rel8]]
                - why is it so hard to share, integrate notes -- build arguments?
                    - -> [[argument mapping]]?
                    - [[argumentation theory]]
                    - [[stephen toulmin]] -> [[toulmin model of argument]]
                - [[the big fungus]] == https://thebigfungus.org
                - interested in the scaffolding, infrastructure to share ideas
        - read an interesting article today, conservative point of view with good arguments even though some disagreeable premises
            - how do we put this article up to scrutiny and learn from it together?
                - -> [[web annotations]]?
                - [[gyuri lajos]]
                    - **[[jerry michalski]] let's have a group sync with Gyuri?**
                    - [[chris aldrich]] trails are related to [[vannevar bush]]'s
        - wishlist for [[fotl]]: how do these parts fit together?
            - how do we make it so that our notes provide maximum utility, spread through the big fungus
    - [[chris aldrich]] would like to focus on how to
        - make it all work together
        - make the systems be easy to use
        - make something that is as simple to understand as facebook?
        - "the [[stream]] flows by too fast"
            -

- Attending: [[jerry michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[chris aldrich]]
- Our personal history
    - Diego en Córdoba
    - Jerry Michalski pasos por sudamérica, ahora en Portland
    - Eduardo de Buenos Aires, ahora en Suiza
- Relationships locally and globally
- Jerry: [[open global mind]] meeting just before
    - Send email to sociate@gmail.com to sign up :)
- ([[chris aldrich]] joined, introductions)
    - [[jerry michalski]]
        - [[the brain]]
        - [[chris]] any shares in the company?
        - not anymore
        - do you have backups?
        - occasionally :) but the format is a big bag of [[json]] objects, not bery interoperable
            - wishlist: [[open global mind]] platform instead
    - [[diego de la hera]]
        - hypothes.is user, contributor as the maintainer of the unofficial extension for firefox; working with [[wikimedia foundation]]
        - met Chris through hypothes.is
    - [[chris aldrich]]
        - background: biomedical and electrical engineer, been on the web since the early 90s
        - [[indieweb]] / https://indieweb.org
        - [[open web backup]], strong belief in owning your own domain, your own data, your own identity
        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[jerry michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space
    - it should allow all users to view data through their chosen tools
    - sometimes you change tools as you shift what you need to do (they are good at different modes of thinking)
    - [[planes]]
        - [[multi plane camera]], [[disney history]]
            - similar to layers in photoshop/gimp
        - bought https://www.playnz.dev
    - [[kumu]] == https://kumu.io
        - is it open source?
    - [[jupyter notebooks]] are an inspiration
    - https://thebigfungus.org
        - [[leaf cutting ants]]
        - ([[diego de la hera]] worked with them)
        - [[symbiotic relationship]] with the fungus
    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
        - [[jerry]] +1 -- the big fungus is a metaphor for the result of this collaboration. But [[playnz]] might be an [[mvp]]/[[demo]] or just an experiment/playground for interoperability.
        - are these tools perhaps already playns?
            - they might be, yes.
        - [[chris aldrich]] [[progressive enhancement]] is key
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
            - how can we take all these tools and build an architecture that supports progressive enhancement?
            - we start with plain text as the base, then you can add things like markdown/html, then you add photos/media
        - [[flancian]] problems and opportunities:
            - exploring hub architecture vs full graph integration
            - lossiness as you interop through tools, playns
            - complexity of integrations
                - [[chris aldrich]] pairwise compatibility is a nightmare
        - [[translation as a service]]

    - possible [[lingua francas]]
- [[chris aldrich]] "The world lost so much because Vannevar Bush didn't use the word commonplace book in his article As We May Think."
    - how can we take open tools like [[logseq]], or semi-open like [[obsidian]], and create a reusable store
