### Attending

[[Jerry Michalski]]
[[Chris Aldrich]]
[[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
[[David Weinberger]]
[[Mathew Lowry]]

### Notes

- [[Anagora]] shared notes 
- Commonplace books 
    - Passed down
    - Example: [[Darwin]] 
    - Easier to do now on the web while active, harder to preserve 
        - https://indieweb.org/longevity
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - Context.center 
        - [Timelines at work](https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-timelines/) - I find timelines to be really useful on understanding and progressing things and finding pattersn and understanding causes.
    - Logging git work and developing in public to make reference easier. 
        - [[Paul Frazee]] - works on Beaker and other Hyper projects. 
            - Really cool logging of code work linked with live streaming -  https://paulfrazee.medium.com/building-in-the-open-70ac9dccf1aa 
        - fightwithtools.dev - stream of thought developer notes linked to git commits (still in progress). Trying to make my work more approachable. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]]: What about [[Spaced Repetition]]
    - mnemonic reading
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/6900f8c3-d117-94dc-4996-39241bd989e0/ 
    - Chris Aldrich: [Piotr Wo≈∫niak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher))
    - [[mnemonic reading]]
    - https://www.enki.com/ ? 
    - Duolingo
    - A useful version of this is active notetaking while reading articles - perhaps combined
        - Refrence to Genius and other web highlighting/note-taking layers that exist 
    - https://www.sorenbjornstad.com/writing/ 
    - [[David Weinberger]] Automated summerization could play a role here? 
    - [[Mathew Lowry]]: Something I want to add to MyHub
        - Imagine you are creating another piece of content in the same zone - remember you asked this question to yourself 5 months ago?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: Recently worked on a timeline learning tool - where you get a package of articles in a timeline and it tracks your reading of each article. I wonder if it works with the automated summization content to create learning cards?
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: It might be interesting to see about giving people different orders of articles than just date saved, that they store so they can build narratives out of those cards. 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: You can pull date from metadata btw. Also: Narrative creation by ordering cards is really interesting. One example of this is Will Wright's tool for Current TV - https://hacktext.com/2011/02/crowd-sourced-television-goes-to-the-next-level-with-bar-karma-and-storymaker-477/
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Founder of https://redforester.com/ is working on something similar that takes elements and can organize them in different ways. I recommended animation to different forks. 
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: Taking notes then reviewing them - asking yourself a question that forces you to give yourself an answer. Example: [[Cornell Notes]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes 
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Five Rs of Note Taking: 
        - Recite
        - Record
        - Reduce
        - Reflect
        - Review 
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: Do you have a set of pre-generated questions that you can slot specific things into or is it more freeform? (To Chris)
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: [[Cloze]] process where, when you are writing it/taking up the notes you use brackets that mean you are already writing the card. 
        - Have to make sure the questions are not too open ended. 
        - Usually one or two sentences with only a few things missing. 
        - I use it very sparingly because I have other methods I prefer to [[Spaced Repetition]]
        - Actively linking notes also helps a great deal. 
    - book: Memory Craft: Improve Your Memory with the Most Powerful Methods in History (2019)
- [[Jerry Michalski]] AR projects seem to lack informational, helper, curational stuff.

- Formats and protocols to exchange and connect knowledge 
    - [[flancian]] thinks of Anagora as a reference implementation of [[agora protocol]], which is this protocol
    - What are the standard objects that move back and forth on this protocol? What is the shapes and how can they enable information exchange and connection? 
        - Does this connect with ActivityPub? Could we send objects and federate "brains" in this way?

            - how can I pull up 2, 3 nodes that bring up a certain number of text blocks that can then be assembled into long form text or some other format that is fit for consumption by others?
                - linear version is one output format, likely the most useful one
                - interactive experience as an alternative?

- going back to the [[flatten]] problem (going from n notes to a long form text)
    - [[flancian]] two possible approaches

        - train and use large language models with notes being part of prompts
    - [[dimensionality problem]]
        - [[planarity]] as first target when processing a high dimensional graph

with my Brain notes here: https://bra.in/8px4ZK

### Notes
- Where to track a recurring agenda/our goals?
    - [[jerry michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev
    - [[chris aldrich]] something that has worked for indieweb is having people who join show a token of interest; e.g. try to improve something for someone
        - i.e. we can talk all day, but improvements to real systems are what we should be shooting towards
        - we could focus here on integrating systems that already exist (the ones we're building or fostering individually) as a group
    - [[flancian]] let's try to spot patterns (...)
- [[aram zucker-scharff]]
    - works for the [[The Washington Post]]
    - developed [[pressforward]], a tool for [[wordpress]]- http://pressforward.org/
    - building easy to use websites, archives -- in a way that allows them to interact with each other
        - https://context.center/
        - https://github.com/AramZS/contexter
        - https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-pages/
    - [Aram on the Fediverse](https://indieweb.social/@Chronotope) 
    - interested in solving [[misinformation]] and [[archival]]
    - for note taking, [[markdown]] on [[git]]
        - [[flancian]] https://anagora.org
- [[fellowship of the link]], a crowdsourced introduction :)
    - [[zettelkasten]], [[commonplace books]], [[tools for thought]], [[personal knowledge graphs]], [[interlays]]
    - [[chris aldrich]] lots of projects in this space are trying to sell something; but we care most about the [[commons]]
    - how do we take idea capturing and generating and link them into a healthy [[knowledge commons]]?
- [[logseq]] model as it relates to the commons
    - taking VC money seems slightly worrying as they'll want to be repayed
    - https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
    - [[logseq]] looks close to [[obsidian]]
        - do we have enough variety of approaches?
    - paying for services is fine
- [[you need a wiki]]
- [[agenda]]
    - #push [[rel8]]
        - https://wiki.rel8.dev
        - [[jerry michalski]] [[rel8 pioneers]]
    - [[flancian]] let's all push our projects onto a shared space and talk by default about interlinking and integrating them?
    - [[chris aldrich]] let's start a list of resources and repositories? 
        - this may help to bootstrap a [[commons]]
        - [[jerry michalski]] [[mycelium]]
- [[jerry michalski]]
    - [[liberating voices pattern language]]
        - [[1 2 4 all]] ~ [[one two four all]]
- [[bouncepaw]]
    - [[mycorrhiza]]
    - [[hypha]]
- [[flancian]] let's build an [[agora]]? :)
    - this seems to be what we're trying to achieve this, regardless of the name?
- let's bring to the next meeting -- a list of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- [[affordances]]
    - [[wikilinks]] and [[metadata]] as key to the [[commons]]
- [[meta]] about chat
    - let's prefer the [[mattermost]] to [[jitsi chat]]
- [[jerry michalski]] what's the difference between [[indieweb]] vs [[fediverse]]
    - [[chris aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is a subset of [[indieweb]]
    - [[chris aldrich]] [[indieweb]] is based around the notion of having your own website and building your identity around it
    - [[chris aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is based around the notion of your identity being hosted in an instance like [[mastodon.social]]
 
 - Let's discuss what we wrote to [[rel8]], our lists of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- People who need access to the repo (github usernames):
    - flancian
    - aramzs
    - bouncepaw
    - chrisaldrich
    - mathewlowry
- Let's talk about [[search engines]]
    - https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/2022-07-02-providing-meaningful-search-results-without-own-index.html 
    - [[queries as addresses]]
- Phone service vs Internet service analogy: https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
- Let's onboard everybody to the [[fediverse]]!
    - [[mastodon]] app is actually good to bootstrap/choose an instance
- Dump your ActivityPub IDs here ;)
    - @flancian@social.coop
    - @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com
    - @bouncepaw@lor.sh 
- What do we see as our long term goal?
    - [[flancian]] let's integrate repositories and tools and write [[science fiction]] together :) how could our tools, platforms, the internet, the world at large look like by [[2025]], [[2030]]?
    - [[mathew lowry]] is focusing on producing the [[pkg book]] chapter and would love to do research and writing in this space
    - [[jerry michalski]] would like to participate in exploration and prototyping; illustrate and broadcast interesting ideas for others to pick up; analyze what it will take to deliver this by the next decade; organize activities
    - [[chris aldrich]] appreciate the idea of [[shared wikis]] that can communicate back and forth with each other
        - [[flancian]] we should invite [[ward cunningham]]!
        - [[chris aldrich]] history of the medium
        - [[jerry michalski]] [[songlines: the power and promise]] 
            - [[chris aldrich]] [[third archive]]

## 2022-06-30
- Attending: [[jerry michalski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[diego de la hera]] [[flancian]]
- [[jerry michalski]] 
    - #push [[rel8]] 
        - #go https://www.rel8.dev
            - (a [[google site]])
            - https://www.rel8.dev/wiki is embedded above
        - "relating ideas, documents, perspectives and people"
    - (Jerry is using [[obsidian]] plus [[obsidian sync]] for this)
    - [[short term]], [[medium term]] and [[long term]] goals for [[rel8]]
    - [[short term]]
        - define: how do we share notes?
        - import [[jerry's brain]] from [[json]] into [[obsidian]] and [[excalidraw]]
            - [[Zsolt Viczi√°n]] (https://www.zsolt.blog/) is interested in doing this
        - what do we put on [[rel8]]?
            - a list of formats/processes that are sufficient for us to 'store our brain' comfortably?
            - [[mathew lowry]] user requirements exercise
        - [[flancian]] on a hub architecture for integrating brains and negotiating exchange (format conversion)
            - [[underlay]], [[interlay]], [[overlay]] as per [[metasj]]
        - [[mathew lowry]] decentralized or centralized?
            - decentralized is the idea (or distributed)
        - [[mathew lowry]] what should we be using as way of standards to create this?
        - [[chris aldrich]] text -> markdown -> html
            - (shared by default is convenient but can be problematic)
            - text as the basic standard
            - then add links, e.g. markdown or org mode
            - then html, microformats, json, yaml can be layered on top
            - exchanged p2p (distributed) or via hubs
        - [[mathew lowry]] interested on web mentions, fediverse as they exist in the data exchange ecosystem
        - [[chris aldrich]] how can you design a minimum building block that is interoperable with other pieces?
            - [[web mentions]] takes the older ideas of pingback/trackback, strips them down to the essentials. it's a notification system via [[post]] requests.
            - [[mastodon]] could support web mentions (there was talk about this a few years back)
            - if X writes a post about URL A by Y, Y will be pinged
            - Y receives the notification, can do some spot checks (does the call refer to a post that actually has the expected link), and then does whatever it wants with it
            - [[activitypub]] could take advantage of [[webmentions]] as a building block, but it mostly doesn't
                - [[kevin marks]] (sp?) added microformats to [[mastodon]]
       - [[flancian]] decentralized vs distributed approach, web3 and all
       - [[jerry michalski]] technical details vs ease of use
       - [[flancian]] two directions we could go in:
           - text as the standard makes it easy to use actually as users can write text wherever they want, a priori
           - focusing on making existing tools and ecosystems easier to use/onboard to
       - [[chris aldrich]]
           - high tech skills: you set up your own mastodon instance, agora, etc.
           - medium: you produce information, content but someone else pays the [[admin tax]] (you contribute to an instance)
           - (spectrum)
           - no technical expertise
           - #push [[blot im]] is very useful, imports from whenever you want
               - [[flancian]] nice, and it's open source: https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot
               - wanted to do this for the Agora so this is super helpful
       - [[mathew lowry]]
           - who are we building this for?
           - "instagram user" might be too wide a net?
           - disconnect from building a knowledge graph and writing for others
       - [[jerry michalski]]
       - #push [[nuggets, remedies and pov]]
           - [[nuggetization]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related
       - [[public]] vs [[private]] as a default
           - [[public]] as default seems better to seemingly most of us
       - [[chris aldrich]] mostly these days notes start in [[hypothes.is]]
           - periodically gets feedback about how cool it is to work in public
       - [[jerry michalski]] [[fedwiki]]
           - [[twitter]] user 509 here (!)
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - going back to what we have in mind and where our ideas overlap
           - not really sure what he's expecting here, but a tool that would be interesting would be like this:
               - like the agora, where you could see it from two different perspectives
                   - as a personal tool, where an individual user decides which graphs converge on the agora
                   - "mix and match" feeds and gardens, an aggregator
                   - like an [[agora view]]
               - another agora is closer to anagora.org, where you push many graphs to a place but where the owners of the repos decided that in advance
           - an extension or tool could be written so that the nodes you see could be actual URLs, and incoming/outgoing links would be those around your internet context (social graph, feeds)
           - [[jerry michalski]]
               - [[apple's]] [[knowledge navigator]] video back in 1986
       - [[adversarial interoperability]]

## 2022-06-09
- Attending: [[jerry michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[chris aldrich]]
- Inviting others
    - [[flancian]] been inviting people already, but would be like to use some kind of policy?
    - [[jerry michalski]] suggest to use the Mattermost to coordinate; use this space to consider together our goals and attract others like this
       - [[mattermost]] https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-fellowship-of-the-link
    - let's use the list of people in the [[doc]] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAourQe_MKh0uWomLsS_V5ea3zm30g8paE49X56jIHs/edit
        - to brainstorm on who to invite if you want to discuss a priori

            - [[diego de la hera]] mastodon.social could be seen as the default
            - (instance delegation could be interesting, web of trust like)
            - http://www.unmung.com/mastoview is a tool for helping to choose Mastondon instances

        - [[jerry michalski]] [[barry schwartz]] https://bra.in/4jXVP2
            - [[the tyranny of choice]]
            - [[schelling point]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] with more choice you usually get increasing complexity
            - you are given so much choice it's almost too much (in the indieweb)
            - [[jerry michalski]] templates, walkthroughs add a lot of value
            - [[chris aldrich]] you need either a lot of time or people motivated because they're building business

                - -> [[web annotations]]?
                - [[gyuri lajos]]
                    - **[[jerry michalski]] let's have a group sync with Gyuri?**
                    - [[chris aldrich]] trails are related to [[vannevar bush]]'s
        - wishlist for [[fotl]]: how do these parts fit together?
            - how do we make it so that our notes provide maximum utility, spread through the big fungus
    - [[chris aldrich]] would like to focus on how to
        - make it all work together
        - make the systems be easy to use
        - make something that is as simple to understand as facebook?

    - [[dan whaley]] youtube annotations are a side project / hobby
        - [[docdrop]] https://docdrop.org/
- [[diego de la hera]]
    - web annotations were mentioned; thought of two connections
        - [[peter hagen]] -> [[lindylearn]] https://lindylearn.io/ and specifically https://annotations.lindylearn.io/new/
            - social platform where you would find what other people are annotating and join the conversation
            - provides a discovery layer for what others are reading and thinking about
        - [[chrome]] is also tackling annotations
        - [[worldbrain]], [[memex]]?
        - it seems like here we want to work more on the level of how to connect different annotation tools at a (federated?) layer
            - perhaps what we need is an integration device at this layer, e.g. [[wikilinks]]

        - occasionally :) but the format is a big bag of [[json]] objects, not bery interoperable
            - wishlist: [[open global mind]] platform instead

        - [[indieweb]] / https://indieweb.org
        - [[open web backup]], strong belief in owning your own domain, your own data, your own identity
        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[jerry michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space
    - it should allow all users to view data through their chosen tools

    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
        - [[jerry]] +1 -- the big fungus is a metaphor for the result of this collaboration. But [[playnz]] might be an [[mvp]]/[[demo]] or just an experiment/playground for interoperability.
        - are these tools perhaps already playns?
            - they might be, yes.
        - [[chris aldrich]] [[progressive enhancement]] is key
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
            - how can we take all these tools and build an architecture that supports progressive enhancement?
            - we start with plain text as the base, then you can add things like markdown/html, then you add photos/media
        - [[flancian]] problems and opportunities:
            - exploring hub architecture vs full graph integration
            - lossiness as you interop through tools, playns
            - complexity of integrations
