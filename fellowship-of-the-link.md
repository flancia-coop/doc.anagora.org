### Notes
- Introductions!
- [[jerry michalski]] ~ #jm
    - on previous calls
    - on sometimes having overlap in different dimensions but not having shared clarity/understanding
    - sharing clarity vs rambling
    - happens even at the organizational level when you're trying to set up a mission statement
        - [[motherhood statements]] ~ "we believe in X", "we believe in Y" -- but we're usually looking for nuggets of novelty
    - [[numenta]]
        - would like to jump into a "digested format"
        - [[prediction framework]]
            - as [[society of mind]]
- #push [[Gene]] and [[Jerry Michalski]] go way back
    - [[system thinker]] -> [[storyteller]]
    - #go https://bra.in/8vGe9q
    - married and divorced [[the brain]] multiple times
    - uses [[napkin]]
    - [[richard maxis]] ~ [[richard macksey]], former Johns Hopkins University professor with a large personal library
    - #push [[richard macksey]]
        - [[library background]]
        - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/34f84a89-4bc2-46f5-ac9b-b3ba8e8bff11/notes
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvXUHI331k
        - [[umberto eco]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czc_KjWji8E
        - [[library tours]]
- Spider chart example
    - reusable ethical services might be a competitive advantage of tools in the [[commons]]
    - commercial tools seem to have an advantage in the current market -- they get the backing of the market "leads" (VC, etc.) which lets them out-compete freer options
        - uber is not a [[fair marketplace]], yet it outcompeted more ethical alternatives
        - on the [[hypocrisy]] of "fake markets" -- platforms that behave like markets but are controlled by a single entity
            - #push [[fake markets]]
                - https://bra.in/8vBe4W
    - [[chris aldrich]] ~ #ca if we did [[spider graphs]], how do you select axis to focus on?
        - how do we present this information in a way that prioritizes the ethical aspect, and perhaps helps tool developers prioritize lacking dimensions?
        - #jm selecting dimensions in different contexts
        - #jm finding which tools are missing, which tools are complementary
            - "which tools play well with each other"
        - #ca another thing which is important to people in this space: even though [[obsidian]] is not open source, people find it easy to develop against it and it's got open source extensions
            - so it seems unlikely they will turn into a new Twitter
            - but even in that case it seems you could move to other players which are more open
    - [[bentley]] implemented [[filtering]] in [[spider graphs]] (demo)
    - #jm what is [[indieweb]]'s perspective on convincing people to build openly?
        - #ca #push [[indieweb]] they have built a structure on a two prong idea:
            - you own your own domain name
                - [[flancian]] ~ #f what about weakening this into "you own some URL space"
                - #ca it's possible, but at the end of the day you want to own what a URL resolves to
                - the ecosystem is developing in the direction of letting you redirect between domains
            - you have control over your data
            - #jm what about separating data from apps, e.g. storing on github?
                - as in, you map any new tool to the same existent dataset
                - #ca you can point tools in [[indieweb]] to repositories of data
                - #ca #push [[micropub]] is a spec; a "data plug board" that allows people to easily write apps that publish events to different consumers
                    - #go https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
                    - a post goes first to your website
                    - then the website has the know how on how to publish to feeds
                    - [[bookmark service]] is the [[hello world]] here
                - [[medium]] could rewrite its backend to support [[micropub]] and it would let you cross post to many other sites
                - #f how does this interact with [[activitypub]]?
                    - #ca it fits in this model but it's a steeper learning curve
                    - in most of the AP space, if you don't interop with [[mastodon]], you don't exist
                    - lots of tools target [[mastodon]] as it supports some core things well
                - [[aram zucker]]
                    - guide to [[activitypub]]: https://tinysubversions.com/notes/reading-activitypub/
                - #push [[fotl agenda]] 
                    - the field of [[x clone]] in the [[fediverse]]
                    - no single AP client that supports all features
                    - [[lemmy]] as an interesting example of new platform built on [[activitypub]]
                    - [[goodreads]] functionality
                        - #ca https://indieweb.org/personal_library#Silo_Examples
    - back to meta level here?
        - on mapping of the fediverse, of tools?
        - or [[spider charts]]
            - #f [[go/t4t radar]] points to the chart (- and + also work for spaces)
                - which categories do we want here?
                - linking articles to support scores/opinions
                - #f [[assertion feeds]]
                - #jm spreadsheet is easily embeddable to begin with
                - #ml publishing markdown/resources to repositories and sharing that
            - #f [[gardens]] and [[feeds]]? :)
            - #ml can we add domains/repositories to what is searching?
                - #f yes
            - [[aram zucker-scharff]] ~ [[az]]
            - #jm [[noosphere]]
            - #ca most of the big commercial offerings allow people to store data on [[dropbox]] or [[google drive]]
                - [[agora]] could enable people to move from [[dropbox]] to [[git]] based workflows
                - micropub spec ostensibly could be used for moving from platform [[x]] to platform [[y]]
    - [[solid]] and [[solid like]]

### Agenda 
- [[2022-08-19]]: recap of Render Conference for Tools for Thinking https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking
    - done!

### Notes
- [[jerry michalski]]
    - [[render]] ~ [[tools for thinking]]
- [[flancian]]
    - great introduction
    - great conversation with [[howard rheingold]]
    - amazing announcement by [[gordon brander]]: [[noosphere]]
        - it is [[an agora]], done very well!
- [[jerry michalski]] welcomes [[dan whaley]]!
  - [[dan whaley]]
      - Fridays are much better meeting wise!
      - very busy but 
      - [[14 million dollars]] investment from [[ithaka]] and [[jstor]] https://web.hypothes.is/blog/say-hello-to-anno/
  - how does this interact with the global [[knowledge commons]]?
      - [[annotations]] -> the knowledge is in the annotation you take
      - but the annotation is layered on preexisting on knowledge
      - it's about protocols and things but also about seeding [[communities]]
  - [[hypothesis]] cares about the user having access to the underlying knowledge
      - regardless of whether it's because it's free or they happen to have (exclusive?) access
      - this knowledge could be resolved in a federated network
          - clients using open protocols like [[web annotations]] can participate in this network
      - [[flancian]] how does this relate to [[markets]]?
          - and the fairness of said markets.
          - IMHO [[commons]] should [[embed]] markets
          - [[dan whaley]] the knowledge is what's "out there" right now, we try to pass no judgment and support the existing models
              - most universities have access to [[json]], but most others don't
              - the [[nyt]] is not free
                  - > paywalls
              - some content might always be gated
              - the world may be moving towards [[free access]] but that will happen on its own terms?
              - [[hypothesis]] thinks there's a sustainable path for them; charging for institutional usage maybe but making the conversation available to everybody
                  - not doing ads
                      - -> [[reality distortion matrix]]
                      - silos trying to [[monetize attention]]
                  - constructive ways of funding
                  - open [[saas]]
       - [[mathew lowry]] have you watched [[render]] / [[tools for thinking]]
           - [[dan whaley]] not yet!
           - [[mathew lowry]] interesting ai potential exploration
           - what are your thoughts on integrating AI with hypothesis?
               - "here is what your friends think about X in the web" vs "here is what an AI thinks about X in the web"
               - [[dan whaley]]
                   - AI is super interesting as created by humans for humans
                   - a force for good to help us navigate the world more powerfully
                   - but of course there are negative use cases, so we need to set the right incentives
               - [[flancian]]
                   - may not there be a difference in the long term? :)
               - in terms of influencing AI
                   - (... saw something in chat :))
               - mathew: valuable content layered on top of layered content.
                   - -> sentiment analysis and meta sentiment analysis
                   - people benefiting from the AI they train instead of the current status quo
               - [[dan whaley]] very privileged to have access to this data, and to steer a new paradigm
                   - find revenues that can sustain this while being pro social is critical
                   - only will explore what will be beneficial
               - [[jerry michalski]]
                   - [[douglas tomkins]] (sp?) and [[x]] from [[patagonia]]
                   - building land tracts and are trying to turn it into a trust
                       - (!)
                   - is there one ambitious funding project that could be explored for maximum benefit here?
                   - could we fund the [[idea commons]] on some large, ambitious scale?
                       - [[flancian]] using the commons, regulating markets, to disrupt the market for public good
                   - [[dan whaley]] what is the change we want to make?
                       - you could imagine all kinds of things
                           - one idea: how could you incentivize people to make annotations professionally?
                           - meaning high quality "trailblazers"
                           - proposed legislation
                           - pre annotating bills!
                           - what would it take to be able to fund this
                       - concept of [[reddit gold]]
                           - chip in to providing high quality contributions?
                       - fixing the [[newspaper subcription model]]
                           - you put 10 bucks in, it goes to the authors of the things you read
                           - [[jerry michalski]] reinventing [[xanadu]] in a way
                       - [[jerry michalski]]
                           - the large pot of money (a risk in itself, but) can be distributed
                           - [[dan whaley]] it's a flow
                           - like mycellian nutrients
                           - [[flancian]] meta on the metaphor
                           - [[chris aldrich]] [[redwood trees]] network roots to be able to stand up taller
                               - for most trees, they tend to be mirror images
                               - not so redwoods
                       - [[data trust]]
                         - [[chris aldrich]] how to get good quality data in general  
                             - [[twitter]] is already a great repository of annotations in a sense, but you have to sift through a lot more stuff to go to the gems
                             - [[jerry michalski]] [[nugget ratio]] is very high if you curate your follows
                             - [[flancian]] -> the [[social network]] is what encodes the most information
                                 - the importance of [[open ranking]], [[open filtering]], [[open algorithms]] -> [[open ais]]
                             - [[jerry michalski]] why are [[tools for conversation]] not [[tools for thinking]]?
                                 - the lack of good permalinks in interesting answers in random forums

### Notes
Jerry's brain for this session: https://bra.in/6p63ZP

- [[betaworks]] conference: https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking
- [[Mathew Lowry]]
    - WordPress plugin to syndicate news orgs from multiple sites of different languages 
    - Would be useful to give publishers more to cite and a better understanding  
    - A type of shared memory 
    - Hard to get journalists to adopt the tool
    - A bunch of different organizations sharing the tools for mutral benifit. 
    - From Mattermost - https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/gbonf7z177yquffqz59mu8uino :
        - The basic idea was to create CMS plug-ins for newsrooms which would allow journalists in different participating newsrooms to access each other's content, both published and otherwise (ie, drafts, notes, etc.), via their CMS. The  participating newsrooms essentially become a sort of decentralised press agency. This is particularly interesting in Europe, where every newsroom cannot have a journalist in every country. Hence the system would incorporate machine translation, autocategorisation and autosummary. Obviously, every time newsroom A used newsroom B's content - ie A translated and republished B's article into their own language for their own audience - newsroom B would earn credit. And every time B used A's, they would spend that credit.
        - This is a very specific use case, with a business model, for decentralised sharing. And the social benefit is real, because it would set up a decentralised alternative to the big press agencies and allow stories which they will never pick up to travel across borders and find new audiences.

        - ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_f52edad0579e3a487bf2d8b201765b49.jpg)
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - https://restofworld.org/ 
    - Old version of [[Zemanta]]
        - A blog post "enhanced" by Zemanta https://hacktext.com/2011/02/what-is-a-text-and-how-do-i-hack-it-521/ 
        - https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781849511407/graphics/1407_02_15.jpg 
        - Eventually purchased by Outbrain and killed
    - https://www.distributedmedialab.com/publishers 
- Potential space for this [[WordCamp for Publishers]] https://twitter.com/wcpublishers/
    - Great event, highly recommend! - Aram
- There's the https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/ that is really great. 
- Chris
    - The NYT has a digital archive team of about 3
    - Photos are not fully backed up there
    - 2 decades of working on the problem and not everything is backed up. 
- Mathew
    - The European Commission relies on the Internet Archive for websites they no longer wish to maintain. 
- Jerry
    - YouTube has its own storage problems stuff is not well archived. It is remarkable that they even capture what they can. 
    - The future digital anthropoligsts what will they find?
- Aram
    - Archiving should be something anyone can do and have on their own site 
    - Just like [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) there should also be link once and archive yourself 
    - These systems should be able to talk to each other and share and replicate their resources
- Jerry
    - How does this survive though? My hard drives don't survive me 
- Chris
    - We have this problem with music - we saw how a lot of that music got lost.
    - Tip of the iceburg - so much history is lost 
    - music notation didn't exist in printed forms until about 11th century
- Jerry
    - In Small Things Forgotten 
    - Gravestones are very useful for history. Also potery. 
    - Tiny differences in gravestones over time are fashion trends that are time indicators. 
- Aram
    - I think in terms of preservation we can look at Activity Pub. When you federate with another server it pulls and replicates and distrubutes stuff. It would be great if we could get that done with archives. 
    - Open sourcing is good as well
- Mathew 
    - If you link to something you automatically make a backup is a good idea
    - What does this have to do with content sharing? 
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage
        - http://open-content.net/caw
        - One peice of content can be shared out replicated and shares an address across many locations.
- Smallest Federated Wiki 
- IPFS but pinning is an issue. 
- Collective intellegence - what that means for spread and maintenance 
- Songlines Are the Original Blockchain - https://bra.in/5jQYgm
- Jerry
    - A lot of ways of remembering were intentionally destroyed by colonization 
    - [[Songlines]] are an example of that
    - but it turns out that these ways of handling it are important.
    - Local populations carefully crafting things and being overwritten by colonization. 
- The Biggest Estate on Earth: How the Aborigines Made Australia (2011) 
- Chris
    - [[David Christian]] on [[collective intelligence]]: The beginning of collective knowledge and intellegence as the marker for the beginning of human history. 
-  Jerry
    - Christian talked about how there are not hooks in the work to be able to pull his data out of his finished thesis. 
    - Humans are really good at killing themselves off and then passed down the ways they learned not to. 
- How practices spread and disceminate? 
- We overvalue the written world - Jerry. 
- Mathew
    - An overvalue of memorization 
    - Greeks overvalued it and that was the end point of oral learning. 
- What does a non-literary method look like here? 
- Aram:
    - [Queens Memory](https://queensmemory.org/) - Podcasts as a method of oral history 
    - Memes and emoji as inconographic languages 
- Jerry
    - There are others as well like NPR's project here that do podcasts for oral histories 
    - [[The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image]] (1998) 
- Aram
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis
- Chris
    - Interesting project to 'write' coreography in a way that isn't the standard way of transmitting coreography
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_notation
    - Different ways to lay out colors an images to annotate video - how could you have a recorded record that could be used to recreate a movie from the notes. 
- Graphic facilitators 
- Mathew
    - volcano model for desktop information - starts in the center and slowly flows towards the sides until it falls off the desktop. 
- Aram
    - Reminds me of 3d desktops
        - ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_43742f2c6167180e0f75a72217f54e4e.png)
- Jerry
    - [[Songlines]] on the desktop 
    - Grapiphic facilitation at conferences 
    - Point back at stuff that was written on the wall from a previous day. 
    - What would The Brain look like as the file system for an operating system. 
    - synecure
- Aram
    - Archiving as a regular personal practice 
- Chris
    - References of people who value their knowledge so they protect against it being lost to history. 
        - These bound books over here with all my notes take them out of the house 
- Jerry
    - Tools for thinking - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/4bfe6526-9884-4b6d-9548-23659da7811e/ 
- https://scalingsynthesis.com/
- Scaling Synthesis - Multiplayer TFT https://lu.ma/9a21amd7 from 2022-08-09 video should be available shortly from [[Boris Mann]] et al.
- Should we write a database of these things or should we poll people and publish interviews? What tools do people recommend?
    - Good example: https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book 
    - Would be good to hear from people: 
        - I have this practice 
        - this  is how I use it 
        - this is what it looks like 
        - and this is how I turn it into outputs? 
    - Looking at how people use their information graphs and how they visualize information 
    - It would be really valuable to me to know if I want a good graph this is what it looks like 
    - Why isn't there more documentation of these tools and how could it lead to interoperability 
- Chris
    - Even the history of the tree space isn't as well known or broadly distributed.... 
    - Lima, Manuel. [[The Book of Trees]]: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, 2014. 
        - https://papress.com/products/the-book-of-trees-visualizing-branches-of-knowledge 
        - Jerry: in my brain - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/cff5e4d0-94af-70a0-d710-d324cbdd55e6/ 
- Jerry
    - Could we have a [[pattern language]] for this? 
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language
    - Ex: Light from Two Walls can become a shorthand for talking about loose rules that trigger understand and contextualization. 
    - Ex: [[1 2 4 all]]
        - [Jerry write up of instrumenting](https://wiki.rel8.dev/tile_-_1-2-4-all_zoom_app)
- Mathew
    - Is there a syntax or thesouras for pattern languages
- Jerry
    - Patern Languages of Pattern Languages
        - https://www.hillside.net/plop/2022/ 
    - Chatbots maybe a solution?
        - Hey I'm intersted in Starting with Tools for Thinking
- Aram
    - Maybe just a question and answer page?
- Jerry
    - And then you could feed it into a Chat Bot
- Mathew
    - How do we help people find the right tool for them
    - How do we help people find the right pattern langugage for them. 
- Aram
    - It seem swe have to interview people first and get them to talk us through it. 
    - Do we need a questionaire? 
- Jerry
    - a smorgasbord of thinking tool users' preferences
    - There is some skill required to pull people out of their over-complexity.
- [ ] questionnaire for thinking tool users? 
    - What are you using this tool for and why? 
    - What did you wish your tool suite did? 
    - In the note taking space a lot of people don't think out the longg term value 
    - Creating one or two notes a day over a year before the big affordances become obvious 
    - what is the long term value of your tool suite and process? 
    - create a 3 minute video of your most typical use case 
        - UX Studies Practice here ?
            - Narrate yourself through the proceess and what you are thinking 
- Chris
    - Very few people get to the 3 or 4 month mark where they see pay off from notetaking.
    - Not many people are writing about it as a benefit either. 
- Mathew
    - We need to use the 5 why technique - we need to ask why a lot
    - Not everyone wants to use notes for creation, some are just collectors. 
- Chris
    - Some people have collect a lot of stuff as the only goal and then the assumption is that [[note taking magic]] happens, but that isn't really the case. 
- People find a system and then want to sell it and that can be a problem
    - [[GTD]] aka [[getting things done]] is an example here
    - [[nick milo]] and [[linking your thinking]] https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/
- [[Memory]] and [[major system]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system as a historical example of people selling intellectual systems or frameworks. This is playing itself out again with note taking tools.

            - the cost of writing caps is helped by tools like [[obsidian]] auto completing links once you type \[\[
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] about unicode coalescing (there's a better word for this) in both directions, pros and cons
            - (...)
            - very used to writing in caps anyway
            - ex: platforms like instagram show how people "exploit" hashtags by using many similar ones to have greater reach
            - a platform could actually coalesce hashtags
                - [[triangle thinking]] ~ [[combinatorial creativity]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] operationalizing communal note taking in preparation for [[betaworks]]
    - how do you do note taking?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] almost on git but not currently
            - most of the public stuff starts in [[hypothes.is]]
            - notes in hypothes.is have permalinks
                - actually have two URLs:
                    - one for the page/resource you annotated followed by a trigger for hypothes.is to open and show the annotation in context
                    - one in the hypothes.is domain which refers to the actual annotation proper
                    - "[[js;dr]] problem"
                - [[Jerry Michalski]]
                    - you can share a highlight to a passage using the current #... convention

                - https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/

    - how could we bridge these numbered 1 .. 17 aspects with:

        - hypothes.is annotations on those sections
    - [[mathew lowry]] which level of granularity do you use for your notes? resource/concept/etc.

            - Q: is there typing in [[thebrain]] or some other way to distinguish nuggets from e.g. full resources?
                - it could encode this but the way Jerry uses it loses this information
                - Jerry does not use some features just because they slow him down / they take a lot of time
                - [[Mark Trexler]] uses more of these features and is a [[climate change]] expert.
            - [[chris aldrich]] the labels/wikilinks that you used for these are unlikely to be the same other people use.
                - (but once these are known to all be in a particular resource...)

            - [[flancian]] assume it will work and then make it work :)
                - gather resources of many different types/mental models, all about the same entity/event/thing

### Notes
Jerry's brainf for this meeting: https://bra.in/7j3ewE

- [[Anagora]] shared notes 
- #push [[Commonplace books]]
    - Passed down
    - Example: [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s was left to his family. [[Charles Darwin]] used it and passed it down; it's now in a library
    - Easier to do now on the web while active, harder to preserve 
        - https://indieweb.org/longevity
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - Context.center 
        - [Timelines at work](https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-timelines/) - I find timelines to be really useful on understanding and progressing things and finding pattersn and understanding causes.
    - Logging git work and developing in public to make reference easier. 
        - [[Paul Frazee]] - works on [[Beaker]] and other [[Hyper]] projects. 
            - Really cool logging of code work linked with live streaming -  https://paulfrazee.medium.com/building-in-the-open-70ac9dccf1aa 
        - fightwithtools.dev - stream of thought developer notes linked to git commits (still in progress). Trying to make my work more approachable. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]]: What about [[Spaced Repetition]]
    - [[mnemonic medium]]
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/6900f8c3-d117-94dc-4996-39241bd989e0/ 
    - Chris Aldrich: [Piotr Woźniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher))
    - [[mnemonic reading]]
    - [[Anki]] https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 
    - Duolingo
    - A useful version of this is active notetaking while reading articles - perhaps combined
        - Refrence to Genius and other web highlighting/note-taking layers that exist 
    - [[Soren Bjornstad]] formerly of Anki and now at Remnote has lots of work on spaced repetition https://www.sorenbjornstad.com/writing/ 
    - [[David Weinberger]] [[automated summarization]] could play a role here? 
    - [[Mathew Lowry]]: Something I want to add to MyHub
        - Imagine you are creating another piece of content in the same zone - remember you asked this question to yourself 5 months ago?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: Recently worked on a timeline learning tool - where you get a package of articles in a timeline and it tracks your reading of each article. I wonder if it works with the automated summization content to create learning cards?
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: It might be interesting to see about giving people different orders of articles than just date saved, that they store so they can build narratives out of those cards. 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: You can pull date from metadata btw. Also: Narrative creation by ordering cards is really interesting. One example of this is Will Wright's tool for Current TV - https://hacktext.com/2011/02/crowd-sourced-television-goes-to-the-next-level-with-bar-karma-and-storymaker-477/
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Founder of https://redforester.com/ is working on something similar that takes elements and can organize them in different ways. I recommended animation to different forks. 
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: Taking notes then reviewing them - asking yourself a question that forces you to produce an answer is a far better method of review that simply re-reading material. Example: [[Cornell Notes]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes 
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Five Rs of Note Taking: 
        - Recite
        - Record
        - Reduce
        - Reflect
        - Review 
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: Do you have a set of pre-generated questions that you can slot specific things into or is it more freeform? (To Chris)
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: [[Cloze]] process where, when you are writing it/taking up the notes you use brackets that mean you are already writing the card. 
        - Have to make sure the questions are not too open ended. 
        - Usually one or two sentences with only a few things missing. 
        - I use it very sparingly because I have other methods I prefer to [[Spaced Repetition]]
        - Actively linking notes also helps a great deal. 
    - book: Memory Craft: Improve Your Memory with the Most Powerful Methods in History (2019) by [[Lynne Kelly]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] AR projects seem to lack informational, helper, curational stuff. 
- Useful concept memory palaces: loci
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci
- [[David Weinberger]] 
    - background in philosophy 
    - for past 30 years writing about the ways in which technology effects the ways we think about things. Focused on Machine Learning for the past 5 years. 
    - Working at Google on Ethics and AI
- [[David Weinberger]] - Writing Notes Process
    - Hobbyist programmer
    - Wrote app that lets me take notes in plain old [[ascii]] (text)
    - bibliographic info at top
        - page number, note and tag
    - took notes on a ton of info that way
    - then built an app that let me shunt it all into databases 
    - Went back to Zotero yesterday
        - Couldn't get it to work and it doesn't work the way I want it to. 
    - [yes](https:yes.com) 
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] 
    - I liked [[Endnote]] when someone else was paying for it. 
    - [[Zotero]] is great, not for me really because I'm no longer an academic, but lots of great ways to plug in to it to make it for me.
    - For arguing on the web, that's what I use context.center for. 
- [[Chris Aldrich]]: 
    - Mendeley seems to be shutting down
    - Zotero is useful for annotating PDFs and now does export of notes from .pdfs as of version 6.0
- [[Jerry Michalski]] big charts and zooming in and out of them is one of the problems we need to take on. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]] 
    - [[Harvard Growth Lab]] has an amazing infographic about economics
        - https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/
- Reminds me of - https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder
- [[Cesar Hidalgo]] - https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/
- What do we take on next? Agenda for next week:
    - How to explain the shared memory concept? 
    - A lot of different answers. 
    - Maybe understanding what the technical format is for a "memory" so it can be shared effectively. 
- Where are the YouTube listings of our calls?
    - In Jerry's brain 
    - In the Mattermost chat

- Formats and protocols to exchange and connect knowledge 
    - [[flancian]] thinks of Anagora as a reference implementation of [[agora protocol]], which is this protocol
    - What are the standard objects that move back and forth on this protocol? What is the shapes and how can they enable information exchange and connection? 
        - Does this connect with ActivityPub? Could we send objects and federate "brains" in this way?

            - how can I pull up 2, 3 nodes that bring up a certain number of text blocks that can then be assembled into long form text or some other format that is fit for consumption by others?
                - linear version is one output format, likely the most useful one
                - interactive experience as an alternative?

- going back to the [[flatten]] problem (going from n notes to a long form text)
    - [[flancian]] two possible approaches

        - train and use large language models with notes being part of prompts
    - [[dimensionality problem]]
        - [[planarity]] as first target when processing a high dimensional graph

### Notes
- Where to track a recurring agenda/our goals?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] something that has worked for indieweb is having people who join show a token of interest; e.g. try to improve something for someone
        - i.e. we can talk all day, but improvements to real systems are what we should be shooting towards
        - we could focus here on integrating systems that already exist (the ones we're building or fostering individually) as a group
    - [[flancian]] let's try to spot patterns (...)
- [[aram zucker-scharff]]
    - works for the [[The Washington Post]]
    - developed [[pressforward]], a tool for [[wordpress]]- http://pressforward.org/
    - building easy to use websites, archives -- in a way that allows them to interact with each other
        - https://context.center/
        - https://github.com/AramZS/contexter
        - https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-pages/
    - [Aram on the Fediverse](https://indieweb.social/@Chronotope) 
    - interested in solving [[misinformation]] and [[archival]]
    - for note taking, [[markdown]] on [[git]]
        - [[flancian]] https://anagora.org
- [[fellowship of the link]], a crowdsourced introduction :)
    - [[zettelkasten]], [[commonplace books]], [[tools for thought]], [[personal knowledge graphs]], [[interlays]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] lots of projects in this space are trying to sell something; but we care most about the [[commons]]
    - how do we take idea capturing and generating and link them into a healthy [[knowledge commons]]?
- [[logseq]] model as it relates to the commons
    - taking VC money seems slightly worrying as they'll want to be repayed
    - https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
    - [[logseq]] looks close to [[obsidian]]
        - do we have enough variety of approaches?
    - paying for services is fine
- [[you need a wiki]]
- [[agenda]]
    - #push [[rel8]]
        - https://wiki.rel8.dev
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[rel8 pioneers]]
    - [[flancian]] let's all push our projects onto a shared space and talk by default about interlinking and integrating them?
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] let's start a list of resources and repositories? 
        - this may help to bootstrap a [[commons]]
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[mycelium]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[liberating voices pattern language]]
        - [[1 2 4 all]] ~ [[one two four all]]
- [[bouncepaw]]
    - [[mycorrhiza]]
    - [[hypha]]
- [[flancian]] let's build an [[agora]]? :)
    - this seems to be what we're trying to achieve this, regardless of the name?
- let's bring to the next meeting -- a list of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- [[affordances]]
    - [[wikilinks]] and [[metadata]] as key to the [[commons]]
- [[meta]] about chat
    - let's prefer the [[mattermost]] to [[jitsi chat]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] what's the difference between [[indieweb]] vs [[fediverse]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is a subset of [[indieweb]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[indieweb]] is based around the notion of having your own website and building your identity around it
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is based around the notion of your identity being hosted in an instance like [[mastodon.social]]
 
 - Let's discuss what we wrote to [[rel8]], our lists of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- People who need access to the repo (github usernames):
    - flancian
    - aramzs
    - bouncepaw
    - chrisaldrich
    - mathewlowry
- Let's talk about [[search engines]]
    - https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/2022-07-02-providing-meaningful-search-results-without-own-index.html 
    - [[queries as addresses]]
- Phone service vs Internet service analogy: https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
- Let's onboard everybody to the [[fediverse]]!
    - [[mastodon]] app is actually good to bootstrap/choose an instance
- Dump your ActivityPub IDs here ;)
    - @flancian@social.coop
    - @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com
    - @bouncepaw@lor.sh 
- What do we see as our long term goal?
    - [[flancian]] let's integrate repositories and tools and write [[science fiction]] together :) how could our tools, platforms, the internet, the world at large look like by [[2025]], [[2030]]?
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] is focusing on producing the [[pkg book]] chapter and would love to do research and writing in this space
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] would like to participate in exploration and prototyping; illustrate and broadcast interesting ideas for others to pick up; analyze what it will take to deliver this by the next decade; organize activities
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] appreciate the idea of [[shared wikis]] that can communicate back and forth with each other
        - [[flancian]] we should invite [[ward cunningham]]!
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] history of the medium
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[songlines: the power and promise]] 
            - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[third archive]]

### Notes
- [[Jerry Michalski]] 
    - #push [[rel8]] 
        - #go https://www.rel8.dev
            - (a [[google site]])
            - https://www.rel8.dev/wiki is embedded above
        - "relating ideas, documents, perspectives and people"
    - (Jerry is using [[obsidian]] plus [[obsidian sync]] for this)
    - [[short term]], [[medium term]] and [[long term]] goals for [[rel8]]
    - [[short term]]
        - define: how do we share notes?
        - import [[jerry's brain]] from [[json]] into [[obsidian]] and [[excalidraw]]
            - [[Zsolt Viczián]] (https://www.zsolt.blog/) is interested in doing this
        - what do we put on [[rel8]]?
            - a list of formats/processes that are sufficient for us to 'store our brain' comfortably?
            - [[Mathew Lowry]] user requirements exercise
        - [[flancian]] on a hub architecture for integrating brains and negotiating exchange (format conversion)
            - [[underlay]], [[interlay]], [[overlay]] as per [[metasj]]
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] decentralized or centralized?
            - decentralized is the idea (or distributed)
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] what should we be using as way of standards to create this?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] text -> markdown -> html
            - (shared by default is convenient but can be problematic)
            - text as the basic standard
            - then add links, e.g. markdown or org mode
            - then html, microformats, json, yaml can be layered on top
            - exchanged p2p (distributed) or via hubs
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] interested on web mentions, fediverse as they exist in the data exchange ecosystem
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] how can you design a minimum building block that is interoperable with other pieces?
            - [[web mentions]] takes the older ideas of pingback/trackback, strips them down to the essentials. it's a notification system via [[post]] requests.
            - [[mastodon]] could support web mentions (there was talk about this a few years back)
            - if X writes a post about URL A by Y, Y will be pinged
            - Y receives the notification, can do some spot checks (does the call refer to a post that actually has the expected link), and then does whatever it wants with it
            - [[activitypub]] could take advantage of [[webmentions]] as a building block, but it mostly doesn't
                - [[kevin marks]] (sp?) added microformats to [[mastodon]]
       - [[flancian]] decentralized vs distributed approach, web3 and all
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] technical details vs ease of use
       - [[flancian]] two directions we could go in:
           - text as the standard makes it easy to use actually as users can write text wherever they want, a priori
           - focusing on making existing tools and ecosystems easier to use/onboard to
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - high tech skills: you set up your own mastodon instance, agora, etc.
           - medium: you produce information, content but someone else pays the [[admin tax]] (you contribute to an instance)
           - (spectrum)
           - no technical expertise
           - #push [[blot im]] is very useful, imports from whenever you want
               - [[flancian]] nice, and it's open source: https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot
               - wanted to do this for the Agora so this is super helpful
       - [[Mathew Lowry]]
           - who are we building this for?
           - "instagram user" might be too wide a net?
           - disconnect from building a knowledge graph and writing for others
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
       - #push [[nuggets, remedies and pov]]
           - [[nuggetization]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related
       - [[public]] vs [[private]] as a default
           - [[public]] as default seems better to seemingly most of us
       - [[Chris Aldrich]] mostly these days notes start in [[hypothes.is]]
           - periodically gets feedback about how cool it is to work in public
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[fedwiki]]
           - [[twitter]] user 509 here (!)
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - going back to what we have in mind and where our ideas overlap
           - not really sure what he's expecting here, but a tool that would be interesting would be like this:
               - like the agora, where you could see it from two different perspectives
                   - as a personal tool, where an individual user decides which graphs converge on the agora
                   - "mix and match" feeds and gardens, an aggregator
                   - like an [[agora view]]
               - another agora is closer to anagora.org, where you push many graphs to a place but where the owners of the repos decided that in advance
           - an extension or tool could be written so that the nodes you see could be actual URLs, and incoming/outgoing links would be those around your internet context (social graph, feeds)
           - [[Jerry Michalski]]
               - [[apple's]] [[knowledge navigator]] video back in 1986
       - [[adversarial interoperability]]
           - [[Chris Aldrich]] For the [[adversarial interoperability]] fans: https://granary.io/
           - [[Mathew Lowry]] [[mysilio]]
       - [[myhub]]
           - writing aids to get from notes to defined outputs
       - [[having a somewhere]]
           - [[knowledge contexts]] as a service
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - [[writing toolkit]]
           - #push [[social reader]] tracks, breaks down and integrates feeds
               - #go https://indieweb.org/social_reader
           - https://indieweb.org/Microsub
           - [[micro.blog]] is great
           - [[refbacks]]
               - https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2QvtE9w5zs49x7WUeG8Ut1vywHDLiG2Wkm9p pinged his site
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
           - [[intimacy gradient]] is a pattern in [[a pattern language]]
           - [[the view master]]
               - how do we generalize and integrate the superpowers that each tool gives?
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - would like to highlight the link aspect of how information pieces relate to each other
           - which links are mentioned in that tweet, that post?
           - about the [[great fungus]]
               - still thinking of this as an individual app customized by the user
               - [[personalized fungus]]? [[fungus view]]
- [[minimum viable formats]]
    - text
    - diagrams
- [[goals]]
    - define our [[wheres]] (from [[having a somewhere]])

## 2022-06-09
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Inviting others
    - [[flancian]] been inviting people already, but would be like to use some kind of policy?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] suggest to use the Mattermost to coordinate; use this space to consider together our goals and attract others like this
       - [[mattermost]] https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-fellowship-of-the-link
    - let's use the list of people in the [[doc]] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAourQe_MKh0uWomLsS_V5ea3zm30g8paE49X56jIHs/edit
        - to brainstorm on who to invite if you want to discuss a priori
    - [[flancian]] invited Dan because of his interested in the space + his experience with web standards
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[web]] https://www.fellowshipofthelink.org/
    - who wants admin? :)
        - 0@flancia.org
        - delahera@gmail.com
        - christopherjaldrich@gmail.com
    - we could also start groups in social networks, e.g. linkedin
        - [[flancian]] [[mastodon]]?
        - got stuck in [[choosing an instance]]
            - [[diego de la hera]] mastodon.social could be seen as the default
            - (instance delegation could be interesting, web of trust like)
            - http://www.unmung.com/mastoview is a tool for helping to choose Mastondon instances
        - [[diego de la hera]] lack of defaults as a hindrance to adoption here, in the indieweb as well

            - you are given so much choice it's almost too much (in the indieweb)
            - [[Jerry Michalski]] templates, walkthroughs add a lot of value
            - [[Chris Aldrich]] you need either a lot of time or people motivated because they're building business
            - [[peter kaminski]] introduced [[Jerry Michalski]] to [[obsidian]]
            - on straightforward vs powerful tools
            - [[diego de la hera]] on the power of forks
                - e.g. [[Chris Aldrich]]'s setup is something we could fork to bootstrap a new user's environment
                - people have copy/pasted Chris's website already, full pages at a time :)
       - [[flancian]] [[map of the fediverse]]
- longer term goals / brainstorming / dream sharing
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]
        - series of projects revolving around these issues
            - [[open global mind]], started 2y ago
                - part of a [[flotilla]] with other organizations
                - 8am pacific, standing call for [[ogm]]
            - [[rel8]]
                - why is it so hard to share, integrate notes -- build arguments?
                    - -> [[argument mapping]]?
                    - [[argumentation theory]]
                    - [[stephen toulmin]] -> [[toulmin model of argument]]
                - [[the big fungus]] == https://thebigfungus.org
                - interested in the scaffolding, infrastructure to share ideas
            - [[think camp]] funds startups in this space
                - "profitable businesses that feed the [[commons]]"
        - read an interesting article today, conservative point of view with good arguments even though some disagreeable premises
            - how do we put this article up to scrutiny and learn from it together?
                - -> [[web annotations]]?
                - [[gyuri lajos]]
                    - **[[Jerry Michalski]] let's have a group sync with Gyuri?**
                    - [[Chris Aldrich]] trails are related to [[vannevar bush]]'s
        - wishlist for [[fotl]]: how do these parts fit together?
            - how do we make it so that our notes provide maximum utility, spread through the big fungus
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] would like to focus on how to
        - make it all work together
        - make the systems be easy to use
        - make something that is as simple to understand as facebook?
        - I'd like to see [[commonplace books]] that can "talk" to each other.
        - "the [[stream]] flows by too fast"
            - turning streams into gardens
            - [[neil]] from the Agora has great writing on streams vs gardens, how they relate to each other - https://doubleloop.net/
- [[john borthwick]] at [[betaworks]] has funding for small projects [[think camp]]
- Watch parties
    - [[connection series]]
        - watch these, take notes/diagrams and share/interop
        - -> [[books, paintings, movies, ideas that shaped many people's lives]]
            - https://bra.in/5pxdW6
    - [[dan whaley]] youtube annotations are a side project / hobby
        - [[docdrop]] https://docdrop.org/
- [[diego de la hera]]
    - web annotations were mentioned; thought of two connections
        - [[peter hagen]] -> [[lindylearn]] https://lindylearn.io/ and specifically https://annotations.lindylearn.io/new/
            - social platform where you would find what other people are annotating and join the conversation
            - provides a discovery layer for what others are reading and thinking about
        - [[chrome]] is also tackling annotations
        - [[worldbrain]], [[memex]]?
        - it seems like here we want to work more on the level of how to connect different annotation tools at a (federated?) layer
            - perhaps what we need is an integration device at this layer, e.g. [[wikilinks]]

- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Our personal history
    - Diego en Córdoba
    - Jerry Michalski pasos por sudamérica, ahora en Portland
    - Eduardo de Buenos Aires, ahora en Suiza
- Relationships locally and globally
- Jerry: [[open global mind]] meeting just before
    - Send email to sociate@gmail.com to sign up :)
- ([[Chris Aldrich]] joined, introductions)
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]
        - [[the brain]]
        - [[chris]] any shares in the company?
        - not anymore
        - do you have backups?
        - occasionally :) but the format is a big bag of [[json]] objects, not bery interoperable
            - wishlist: [[open global mind]] platform instead
    - [[diego de la hera]]
        - hypothes.is user, contributor as the maintainer of the unofficial extension for firefox; working with [[wikimedia foundation]]
        - met Chris through hypothes.is
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]
        - background: biomedical and electrical engineer, been on the web since the early 90s
        - [[indieweb]] / https://indieweb.org
        - [[open web backup]], strong belief in owning your own domain, your own data, your own identity
        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[Jerry Michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space
    - it should allow all users to view data through their chosen tools
    - sometimes you change tools as you shift what you need to do (they are good at different modes of thinking)
    - [[planes]]
        - [[multi plane camera]], [[disney history]]
            - similar to layers in photoshop/gimp
        - bought https://www.playnz.dev

        - ([[diego de la hera]] worked with them)
        - [[symbiotic relationship]] with the fungus
    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
        - [[jerry]] +1 -- the big fungus is a metaphor for the result of this collaboration. But [[playnz]] might be an [[mvp]]/[[demo]] or just an experiment/playground for interoperability.
        - are these tools perhaps already playns?
            - they might be, yes.
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[progressive enhancement]] is key
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
            - how can we take all these tools and build an architecture that supports progressive enhancement?
            - we start with plain text as the base, then you can add things like markdown/html, then you add photos/media
        - [[flancian]] problems and opportunities:
            - exploring hub architecture vs full graph integration
            - lossiness as you interop through tools, playns
            - complexity of integrations
                - [[Chris Aldrich]] pairwise compatibility is a nightmare
