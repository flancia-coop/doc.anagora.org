## 2023-03-01
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Flancian]] ...
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[My life as a cyborg]] (mentioned on Free Jerry's Brain on Monday)
    - April posted about it on LinkedIn
    - How do the following mix together?
        - Jerry's Brain
        - ChatGPT
        - Massive Wikis
        - Agoras
    - Hip Hop culture and sampling
        - Previously it was clamped down upon by the recording industry
        - But Hip Hop railed against it and came out on top
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] it might be that hip hop started sampling culture (was there much sampling before that?)
        - Maybe what happened: there was a clamp down and then people started paying for samples, the economic aspect followed
        - [[How sampling transformed music]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3TF-hI7zKc
        - Parallels to how now you can post copyrighted videos/music to Youtube, and monetization "just flows" to the copyright holder
    - Q: Why don't we have a network-based (federated, distributed, etc.) solution for flowing profits/dividends generally?
        - A: mostly probably because copyright holders don't want this, they want a more centralized approach (e.g. meet with Youtube).
    - On [[image generators]] and the associated problem
        - #pk people realized that there was an "asset" up for grabs that wasn't recognized as such: [[style]].
        - Artists seem more concerned about style copying than about copying individual artwork.
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] Style is what an experienced/fully developed artist develops in a way that is recognizable
        - c.f. [[essence]], which these engines seem to be able to latch on
    - [[Copyright Revolution]]
        - #jm [[Attribution]] is extremely important
            - Together with a distributed system for tipping/paying it forward to everybody involved in derivative works
        - [[Embracing Piracy]]
        - #pk agree on almost all except for the idea of paying someone because they were the "root node"
        - #fl [[Revolution Coin]] would give people this flexibility :)
        - #pk but human creativity is already a [[commons]] and it should be recognized as such
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey
        - #ca on attribution as key, and how we:
            - Don't attribute enough (you don't see marketing people or theater owners in movie credits)
            - Could we making more explicit ancillary actors in general
            - China example: after decades of work they're still at 60-70% of where they could be w.r.t. setting up actual distribution networks
        - #jk [[Distributed Accounting of Value Flows]] (Revenue Sharing for Collaboration) https://bra.in/7qeDBy
            - in this space:
                - [[open collective]]
                - [[disco coop]]
            - if this worked, you could drop your 'reward' for a movie in a shared pool and let the right distribution system do the work
     - [[sam klein]] "Any good Fellowship should include generative members"
         - How do we make good on the opportunity to have a more robustly fleshed out world of links, value flows, etc.?
         - [[automated communism]]
         - #ca we've been using [[fame]]; what is its value? does fame have value beyond a marketplace that puts value on fame?
             - [[spielberg]] can make any movie he wants because of fame; he is trading that for something else?
         - #pk [[fame]] as a proxy for respect from people
             - not fungible, might not necessarily feed you
             - #ca [[david graeber]] and [[the dawn of everything]]
                 - "we stole the idea of freedom from them"
                 - [[pirate enlightenment]]
             - #jm [[under the black flag]] is also very good
             - #jm on [[capitalism]]:
                 - Like Cuckoos, Capitalism Had to Push All Other Ways of Living Out of the Nest https://bra.in/5jk43Z
                 - -> [[ontoshift]] is needed
             - #ca [[capitalism]] has competitive advantages, in particular paired with the [[industrial revolution]]
         - #sk [[pull revolution]] instead of [[push revolution]]
             - we should be empowering people to start new variations of society
         - #jm what are our next two [[stacks]]? https://bra.in/5qnYm9
     - What do we *need* to influence this space going forward?
         - Should we start with a [[wishlist]]?
         - Which: devices, people, organizations would we need the support of to get such a project off the ground? Which "things" would 
         - Something there made me think of Generous Thinking by Kathleen Fitzpatrick

- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Flancian]] [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] ...
- (on OGM)
    - born in an [[email list]] ([[Google Group]])
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] on dynamics in mailing lists
        - noisy vs quiet people
            - this problem seems to be less severe in chat? in particular if you can create a new room next door -- people will find their spaces
            - "bloviating"
            - people not being introduced to [[netiquette]]
            - [[slack]] designed around many of the limitations of email (you can rename channels but not (easily) email threads, etc.)
        - email is the lingua franca / mcd tool (pro)
        - email is pretty poor as a conversational medium (con)
    - channels in CSC [[mattermost]] came later
    - [[mini list]]
    - [[chat gpt]] discussion
- email vs matrix vs activitypub vs ...
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] big generational gap with email, almost nobody millenial or younger wants to use email
    - There's also the parallel move from IRC to Slack or Discord :(
        - Note that the ToS for Slack doesn't allow to extract messages from the platform (!).
    - There's also the parallel move from e.g. [[phpbb]] to [[reddit]]/[[stack exchange]]; unclear if some conversations that used to happen in forums are even happening *somewhere* anymore?
    - Aram: where has [[asynchronous play]] gone?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: default settings from products (that e.g. either send notifications to email or not) count a lot here.
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] how to set up customized 'sweeps' (like personal workflows) and share them.
    - [[Aram]] Indieweb has a cross posting version of this that pulls in Discord, Matrix and IRC.
- [[Check ins]]
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]
        - Which kind of structure do we need to find to be a steward of a shared memory for humans?
        - Interested on: note sharing.
            - Let's schedule a next week conversation about this?
        - Using [[Youtube Shorts]] more, liking the [[60 seconds]] constraint
            - [[Indra's net]]
        - Working with Paul Roney (sp?) on a podcast on the history of computing
            - Early visionaries like Bush
            - Plus policy/sense making at societal level, tying in to pandemic response
            - How to contribute this back to the big fungus
   - [[Flancian]]
       - Day job occurrences
       - [[agora 2023]], [[agora 2025]]
       - [[beyond markdown on git]]

       - Work related: trying to push some blog posts through PR
           - At just the right level to be under extra scrutiny
           - Writing precisely about hotspots
       - Continuing to work on the context center (sp?) / timelines.
           - Looking forward to release this code next month, for now it's on a branch.
           - https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-timelines/
           - https://github.com/AramZS/context-center/tree/timeline
           - https://github.com/AramZS/contexter 
           - Inspired by the work of [[molly white]], https://www.mollywhite.net/timelines/wikimedia/, [[web3 is going great]]
           - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[LATCH]]: Location, Alphabets, Time, Categories, Hierarchies 
           - Timelines left-to-right don't work that well on the web; Molly's approach is top-to-bottom/feed like and works great
           - [[Circa]] https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/06/one-thing-we-can-learn-from-circa-a-broader-way-to-think-about-structured-news/
           - [[Circa]] https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/24/8842009/why-circa-failed
           - [[ESC]] - https://www.esc.fyi/ - at [[decent social]] https://decentsocial.net/
               - https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/3/sheet/edit/080b09b30bc627f2c8d884b606ec2922/
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] not used so much to [[check ins]] in Europe :)
        - Thanks Aram for joining the [[massive wiki]] effort!
        - Focusing on ramping up consulting, would love to get a gig related to knowledge organization
        - https://mathewlowry.medium.com/a-minimum-viable-ecosystem-for-collective-intelligence-7738848ce9c4

- Flancian: would like to discuss [[cross posting]] / [[siphoning]] further some other meeting?

            
## 2023-02-15
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[Bentley Davis]], [[Flancian]], [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Start recording, we're currently using Jitsi and that works best with a [[Chromium]] based browser.
- Threads from last time we would like to pick up:
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] would like to generalize the archiving tool / link card generator he's been working on.
    - [[Flancian]] would like to discuss [[Interwiki]] links and the [[common hub]] approach for search and entity resolution
- #push [[fotl threads]]
    - define:
        - [[wiki]] / root URL
        - /now
        - [[issue tracker]] / [[project tracker]] URL
            - [[github]] by default?
- Check ins
    - [[invasion of the body snatchers]]
- [[calendar]] URL
    - [[jerry michalski]] https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/calendar/
    - [[bentley davis]] surprised at the sheet but also understandable
        - would like to maybe code a viewer for calendars/slot finder
    - [[flancian]] have been using [[nextcloud]] calendar for social.coop
- how to share notes right here, right now
    - [[jerry michalski]] who has opinions on how this should look?
        - MVP: [[markdown]] files on git, plus maybe some mechanism to handle conflicts or at least handle contention
        - Some concerns with Obsidian vaults, and the fact that settings seem to be per-vault
        - MVP doesn't currently include sharing all the links in [[the brain]].
            - Would be nice to be able to infer [[massive wiki]] or [[agora]] URL from Obsidian directly.
            - #push [[the brain]]
                - [[vulcan]] is new [[brain]] interface: https://forums.thebrain.com/post/12555295
    - [[flancian]]
        - +1 on markdown on git
            - but it could also be "just a website" that we agree to crawl for notes
                - minimum for that would be: a base URL and a way to inform of the URL scheme that the website is using to serve notes
        - default for me is individual gardens on the one hand and "stoas" or "shared gardens" or just "wikis" as distinct
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]
        - how do you provide context in dense digital gardens/wikis? Without overwhelming users.
        - How to communicate spatial encoding  (e.g. what Jerry does in his Brain), and other conventions.
     - [[Jerry Michalski]] automatic footer surfacing "sister locations", "peers" -- and also how to collaborate in a particular context
     - [[Chris Aldrich]] context graph in the Agora is nice, but:
         - could use more levels (totally)
         - it changes every time, which makes it disconcerting (same in Obsdidian)
         - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] mostly uses the graph to find things that should be linked but aren't
         - [[Jerry]] the brain does time-based and alphabetical sorting of nodes for you
- [[Flancian]] where are your notes? ;)
    - [[rel8]] have it already
    - [[Jerry]] git repos incoming
        - [[brain]] dump
            - maybe later? it's huge
        - [[obsidian]]
            - [[sync]] works nicely
            - [[git]] is preferred
                - [[obsidian git]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] needs to separate public and private notes
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] is doing the same
        - [[markdown on git]]
        - experimenting with this in https://github.com/AramZS/dnd-campaign-site-defectors/blob/main/.husky/pre-commit
        - likes folders
        - trying [[deepdwn]] https://www.deepdwn.com/ for markdown editing and it's built for folders explicitly
        - https://www.dendron.so/
    - [[Bentley Davis]]
        - Mostly uses his physical brain (!)
        - but has some things on Markdown, could work as a pilot.
        - Q: what about including arbitrary html?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] blog / wiki convergence
        - #push [[rel8]]
            - [[rel8 llc]]
            - #push [[multiplayer sensemaking]]
                - https://wiki.rel8.dev/what_multiplayer_sensemaking_needs_now
                - what about a call with Dan?
        
 


## 2023-02-08
- a [[meeting]].
    - #go https://meet.jit.si/fellowship-of-the-link
    - Wednesdays at [[6PM UTC]].
- Attending: [[Peter Kaminski]], [[Jerry Michalski]], [[Bentley Davis]], [[Flancian]], [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] (Late)
- Start recording, we're currently using Jitsi and that works best with a [[Chromium]] based browser.
- Threads from last time we would like to pick up, or new threads:
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] would like to share notes with each other.
        - What does this mean? The lowest common denominator of Markdown on git seems fine to start with.
    - #push [[nostr]]
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] started playing with [[nostr]].
            - Pete's pubkey: npub1peterka3vphw8z8ls7hpl9c9lxh8ww4la36pf97sycdvtantzu8s97x3za
            - Aram's pubkey: 8b9e3e37fb86f7282de4fb526505e2d5748f2cd09e22fbda18f1daa65028e916
            - Read about [[nostr]] vs [[SSB]].
                - Nostr gives everybody permission to speak, but nobody will necessarily listen to you.
            - Still really like it.
            - Warning disclaimer: it's not safe yet.
            - At its heart, it's a way to pass messages between each other through relays.
            - Could we do [[massive wiki]] through [[nostr]]?
                - Massive Wiki is markdown / raw files, but it's also about versioning.
                - It turns out versioning is tricky :)
                - [[git]] solves this locally. People have also implemented many semantic conventions on top of filesystems.
            - Back to Jerry's question: there is a big conceptual leap to 'versions of a file are the same file' from 'versions of the same file are different files'.
            - [[Jerry]] this can be solved with the right UI/metaphors. For example [[fedwiki]] does this in a way that doesn't work for him.
            - [[Flancian]] what does [[nostr]] get us over markdown on git and such?
                - [[Peter]] 'follow a person', [[pki]] infra that is hacky but works.
                - But we need to decide on a versioning strategy.
                - Obvious choices:
                    - git
                    - CRDT or CRDT-ish approaches
                    - [[Pijul]]
                - On "the versioning problem"
                    - The one occassion in which we definitely need to solve the versioning problem is when people are collaborating actively on the same file.
                    - Three aspects?
                        - Storage versioning
                        - UI management of versions/how you surface versions and link to versioned resources
                        - Multiple commit phases in associated workflows.
                - `push` puts what is next on a line (and what is under it in a list?) to be duplicated on that context
                - [[Bentley]] on [[Mathew]]'s post and git, and shortcomings/rough edges in the git experience.
                    - Staging is not needed by most people.
                    - Always pulling latest would be nice.
                - [[Aram]] Nostr has some significant advantages over SSB I think, which is that it is significantly more decentralized and doesn't run into some of the blockchain adjacent stuff that causes ssb problems.
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] on [[Rich Burton]]'s project, https://dxos.org/
        - [[Aram]] [[IPFS]] seems very strong in this space. Same for [[webtorrent]].
            - [[nostr]] is cool conceptually, but it's unclear how it would work for something that is not a messaging process.
            - It's intended to be "slow": You don't need an always on connection to the internet.
        - [[Peter]] on [[syncthing]]
            - Tried it as an alternative to git
            - Syncs really fast actually
            - It let lots of editors feel 'real time'
        - [[Jerry]] on [[vaults]], [[repos]], [[namespaces]]
        - [[Peter]] on messages vs documents
        - [[Jerry]] on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescript_(programming_language) as an example of a protocol designed supporting the "wrong" abstractions at a time in which the document-based web was taking off
    - What's the next step?
        - [[Peter]] let's continue on the [[markdown on git]] path
        - [[Aram]] it seems that what's needed is a predictable 1. path on a site for discovery of content and 2. format.
        - On predictable ways to resolve entities cross-site.
        - [[Peter]] add ".md" to get raw markdown from a massive wiki, e.g., https://massive.wiki/massive_wiki_conceptual_diagram.md
        - Could use [[timegates - https://context.center/topics/memento/

    - Maybe let's think about a few things we would like to do together this year, add them to the agenda or to some note in your digital garden and let's discuss next time?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] would like to generalize the archiving tool / link card generator he's been working on.
        - This takes a line in e.g. a Markdown file with a link; this retrieves that link and archives a simple text version locally. Attempts to archive on archive.org. Generates a [[social card]] that is currently usually generated using a third party API.
        - https://fed.brid.gy/ 
        - Could be a good complement to both [[massive wiki]] and [[agora]] as they're both strongly markdown based.
        - #pk certainly interested :)
        - #ml too, for myhub.ai, which is all about collecting and sharing cards
        - [[flancian]] +1
        - #pk it'd be nice to have a link that is at least "bimodal" -- the target could be local or archive.org
        - Example: https://context.center/topics/indie-search/
        - #pk [[factr]] seems related - https://factr.com/
    - [[Flancian]] would like to discuss [[Interwiki]] links and the [[common hub]] approach
        - #pk [[free jerry's brain]] conversation yesterday 
            - [[marc-antoine parent]] has [[hyperknowledge]] and thinks we need to add a few things to have true interop between tools
                - [[concept broker]]
                - [[nesting]], which means that you need a recursive scheme
                    - [[markdown]] is bad at this
                    - [[maparent]] likes off-band, like [[atjson]]
        - on [[sharing hub]] approach
            - #ca [[sister sites]] - http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SisterSites
                - possible approach: search service / entity resolution extension that lets you search in a number of 'resolution roots'

                - [[flancian]] [[agora ext]] tries to do this 
                - [[aram zucker-scharff]] on tools for search of static sites possibly providing search easily for many different sources of truth

## 2023-01-18
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[Bentley Davis]], [[Peter Kaminski]], [[Flancian]], [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]. If Jitsi will behave, [[Chris Aldrich]] will join in a minute or two...
- Planning for the year
    - Individually and as a fellowship? :)
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev/bigger_goals
        - Trying to be more 'action oriented'
        - Flancian interested in particular:
            - [[shared note taking]]
            - [[pattern languages]]
                - pattern languages vs. lists of patterns
                - [[pattern language workshop]] during the pandemic
            - Instrumenting patterns: some patterns are more amenable to turning into code
                - 1, 2, 4, all [[zoom app]]
                - meta facilitation app
            - [[wikilinks]] and [[hashtags]] as patterns
                - and their advanced used (conventions)
            - [[pattern candidate ideas]]
                - [[aram zucker]] this is the perfect use for a wiki
    - [[Peter Kaminski]]
        - [[John Abbe]] and I are working on "[[SuperLiminal]]", a public wiki
            - started as a [[massive wiki]], coming into focus
            - it's about: [[pattern languages]], [[quality without a name]] ~ [[QWAN]], [[systems thinking]]
                - see <https://codeberg.org/Massive-Wiki/SuperLiminal/src/branch/main/Discussing%20SuperLiminal%2C%202023-01-17.md>
            - open concerns:
                - hard to adopt massivewiki, hard to onboard to it
                - it implies onboarding onto git
                - massive wiki is [[tool agnostic]] but in practice everybody is using [[obsidian]]
                    - one of the things with obsidian is that it's getting more complex and less user friendly as it grows and adds more features
                - Peter's dream system: [[opal]]. simpler and has git built in.
                    - https://developer.massive.wiki/opal
            - interesting idea for [[massive wiki]]
                - original acronym [[MaSVF]] (Markdown, shared, versioned, files)
                - [[Massive Human Intelligence Project]] (2021 as MaSVF Wiki, Markdown Shared Versioned Files, ‚ÄúMassive‚Äù) 
                - federation as markdown attachments in email
            - [[the return of email]]
                - email attachments as a lightweight federation medium
                - node@anagora.org
                - #pk email-in to Obsidian?
                    - [x] [IFTTT and OneDrive, Patrick Berry](
                    https://patrickberry.medium.com/email-notes-to-obsidian-8fba96a7d35b) (Medium)
                        - [x] [Using Integromat and Obsidian Webhooks, bwydoogh](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-send/23899/10) (Obsidian Forum) 
            - [[git]] conflicts
                - on potentially automatically resolving wiki edits
                    - maybe outliner mode makes this easier
                - [[obsidian git]]
                    - keeps improving
                    - #pk atom/pulsar is picked up by non-technical users sometimes though
                    - [[pulsar]] https://pulsar-edit.dev/
            - Flancian: [[mastosearch]] as it relates to discovery of git repository / integration of the [[knowledge commons]]
                - (...)
                - Potential for a bad actor to move first and enclose the commons.
                - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] maybe fragmenting search is the best bet -- e.g. make it easier for people to provision and use search tools
                    - https://context.center/topics/indie-search/
                - Should we worry about the [[enclosure problem]]?
                    - [[Peter Kaminski]]: I worry about enclosures but not about the enclosure problem in general?
                        - In the beginning we didn't have centralized search engines. People chose them out of convenience.
                        - If you're careful enough and say "last time we tried this it didn't work out" maybe it's enough.
                    - You can have the same content in many massive wikis. There is no authoritative versions, etc. So maybe [[massive wiki is enclosure proof]].
                        - Flancian +1 althought the question may be about the size of the backing commons. People may choose enclosure-friendly tools due to their convenience again.
                        - Aram: we need Federation.
                        - #jm [[kosmik]] [[fedwiki]]
                        - #pk https://murmurations.network/
                        - [[chris aldrich]] "The Read Write Web is no longer sufficient. I want the Read Fork Write Merge Web." - [Tantek](https://indieweb.org/2011/Smallest_Federated_Wiki#Inspiration) 
                 - [[jerry michalski]] [[kosmik]] can be described as a distributed filesystem (or is built upon one)
                     - too promiscuous forking as in [[fedwiki]] is confusing
                 - Aram: need to democratize the way we maintain and share search indexes.
                     - Probably also need a way to distinguish 'I am linking to this page' from 'I am giving authority to this page'.
                     - schema.org has a property 'is based on'
                 - [[Peter Kaminski]] [[maparent]] has [[hyperknowledge]] which has similar characteristics
                 - Flancian: client-based [[disintermediation]] as a complementary approach.
                 - Aram: role distribution as we see in wikis? Tools for communities of knowledge.
                 - #pk: xtension values for the rel="" attribute in HTML5: https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions
                 - #ca Or user ability to search a variety of areas based on what they know or trust, so something along the lines of allowing the user to choose their search like https://github.com/CanisLupus/swift-selection-search does 
                 - #ca [[indieweb wiki]]: a community maintaining a wiki and a newsletter coming out each week
                 - #pk [[VoteLinks]]: https://microformats.org/wiki/vote-links

            - Experience of a (academic, see [link](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/my-trip-to-poland/)) in Poland. Poland has a really large problem right now with fascism. Part of it has to do with how they have pushed all responsibility about WWII to Germany.

    - #jm open question: how many OGMs are there?
    - #jm using social tools to make sense of our shared projects instead of individual tools
    - #pk [[kaffeeklatsch]]
- [[chris aldrich]] in his experience with communities, the best model seen is to throw email overboard -- and to use a public [[wiki]] that is easy to edit combined with a [[chat]] that is searchable.
    - #jm proposal:
      - [[mattermost]] for chat -- [[sense doing]]
      - [[massive wiki]] for wiki

    - and email is difficult to archive well 
    - caveat 1: someone needs to maintain it all... 
    - The IndieWeb has an interactive bot that does help to capture from chat into the wiki, but that requires some programming lift to get done. 
    - France vs. Morocco, FIFA World Cup 2022‚Ñ¢

### Thinking Tools Map Project

- website now published, <https://tftmap.massive.wiki/>
  - \o/
  - exciting progress on massive wiki -- Peter presents
      - hacked massive wiki theme to have a notice bar :)
      - had to get involved with some [[css frameworks]]
      - turns out that many sites seem fine with the menu scrolling with the content, having no fixed navbar, etc.
      - bentley: can offer CSS help, has experience
  - (airtable review)
  - #push [[massive wiki wednesday]]
      - https://hackmd.io/95GfL68PRsSc7wieGMgdAQ (temp location only)
      - moving from github to maybe [[codeberg]]
  - hoping to have Phase 0 done next week some time
  - [[permanent versions]]
      - a wiki is supposed to be changing all the time -- so giving a link to a page has always felt slightly weird to Peter, as the target will have changed by the time the recipient clicks on it
      - how to version?
          - point in time / commit, offer a link to HEAD?
          - approach:
              - sha256 / hashing based approach / content based addressing
              - of an html snapshot
                  - flancian: this might introduce dependencies on particular rendering engines
          - comparison vs ipfs actual content based addressing
              - (...)
      - on [[codeberg]] forking [[gitea]]
      - thoughts on [[chat gpt]]
          - 'automatic explanations' for change management/changes in a wiki
      - three word (or whatever) navigation to a particular git hash (sort of like the interface presented by [what3words](https://what3words.com/))
      - making git history more easily navigable by non-technical / non-Git experts
      - date-anchored vs content-anchored
          - interwiki links
  - #push [[gordon brander]] and [[subconscious]]
      - [[jerry michalski]] talked with him on Monday
      - [[noosphere]] would love to have at least a subset of Jerry's brain \o/
  - #push [[paul rony]] -- the founder of [[kosmik]] (sp?)
      - [[french]]
      - loves computer history
      - a podcast / community / etc. to talk about:
          - early visionaries (e.g. [[vannevar bush]])
          - how does that bridge into new tools and visions
- [[flancian]]
    - https://fotl.agor.ai
    - [[agora bridge]] approach / trying to reuse at least importing steps
    - [[jerry michalski]] -- take [[visions]] https://bra.in/2pxbo6 as a starting point, do nth degree crawling
    - [[peter kaminski]] 
        - [[meme brane]]
            - https://memebrane.conversence.com
        - [[jerry's brain]] in a postgresql database, where each node is a row
            - note that Jerry doesn't use node titles 
        - the above already don't map 1:1/well to [[massive wiki]] data structures
        - we're all representing information but that information has different shapes
        - lossy translations can be very lossy
     - [[flancian]]
         - (something optimist)
     - [[jerry michalski]]
         - most of his brain would usually end up looking like small markdown files with a link
         - [[peter kaminski]] relatively easy to move data brain -> massive wiki, but it's not obvious how to go the other way

   - [[peter kaminski]] 
       - Thinking Tools Map Project still chugging along, we're still working on "dimensions" and making good (but slow) progress. We're using Airtable for some of our brainstorming about dimensions.
           - our brainstorming Airtable, take it all with a grain of salt: https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invNGlDl702PpLJw0&inviteToken=6d20ee0fcda6d460240d202c746e1c408db3cf8202a55a860135f3489e498976

## 2022-11-02
- Attending: [[peter kaminski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[aram zucker-scharff]] [[jerry michalski]] [[flancian]]
- [[peter kaminski]] [[airtable]]
    - #push [[thinking tools map]]
        - working on [[project plan]] prior to bringing it to the [[fellowship of the link]]
        - https://dainty-sable-264aa3.netlify.app/project/measuring_thinking_tools.html
    - [[chris aldrich]] [[openness]] axis seems too dense
        - we should also assume that developers will tackle the low hanging fruit / perform minimum effort to tick a box if that's within reach :)
        - [[mathew lowry]] is keen on keeping the number of dimensions low-ish, 6-8 dimensions
            - which would look nice in a spidergraph
        - [[chris aldrich]] also makes sense to apply the pareto principle
    - [[calendar]] https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NW8zbXUzOXAxMWZxNjlydGFwcWV0YnNnZWQgcGV0ZXIua2FtaW5za2lAbQ&tmsrc=peter.kaminski%40gmail.com
        - [[flancian]] link doesn't seem to work?
- [[aram zucker-scharff]] interoperability
    - easiest way is to piggyback on what they're already doing
    - people onboarding onto [[mastodon]]
        - people coming up with lots of new things in the tool space -- many requiring to sign in with both mastodon and twitter
        - [[chris aldrich]] no algorithmic feed, fewer features -- as a feature :)
        - instances are more like twitter lists, at a similar level
        - [[mastodon]] vs the rest of the [[fediverse]], e.g. [[lemmy]] / [[pleroma]]
    - [[bluesky]]
        - associated with [[twitter]], but
        - [[pfrazee]]
    - #jm is there something better than ActivityPub/Mastodon for people that want a replacement?
        - [[flancian]] don't know anything promising currently that is not ActivityPub based
        - [[pleroma]] [[lemmy]] [[misskey]] are all built on top of ActivityPub too
     - [[advertising]] as an option to individuals funding instances as hobby projects
     - [[coops]] as another option
         - #azs [[data coops]]
     - #jm book about quakers / morals and [[travelling brothers]]
         - history of [[guilds]]
         - industrial revolution starts to hit, early capitalists realize they need to undermine the guild system

         - [[apprentice]] -> [[yeomen]] -> [[master]]
         - [[masterpiece]] is what the [[yeomen]] had to build to become a master
         - "advertising is the colonizing force of capitalism in internet spaces"
         - [[mutual aid]] societies yielded technologies like [[insurance]]
         - it feels like we're trying to find our way back to some of these concepts
     - #azs book on modern unions
         - you can't get to the revolution until people feel safe
         - Ah i was thinking of [[Fight Like Hell]] by Kim Kelly 
 ## 2022-10-26
- Attending: [[peter kaminski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[flancian]] [[bentley davis]] [[maparent]] [[samuel klein]]
- Second call on [[Wednesday]].
- Recording in Jitsi only works in Chromium.
    - No firefox, no safari for now.
    - Worth filing a bug.
- Last time recap
    - Integration of tools for thought
    - Hyperknowledge and Agora
    - Debate tools and quality of discourse as they relate to the political scene
- Check ins
    - [[maparent]]
        - Discussed a lot of common issues in [[free jerry's brain]] meeting on Monday.
        - In there we spoke about [[hyperknowledge]] and [[next actions]] as well.
        - Among other things, made a plea for [[concept glue]] between systems.
            - Deep links, deep addressability aspects seem key.
            - Making cross linking easy.
        - Bentley brought up: we could achieve a better understanding by trying some use cases and seeing which kind of maps do we want to build off real data.
            - [[flancian]] we had a pending AI from a previous meeting that 
        - [[frame views]] URLs for concepts and for frames centered around that thing
            - [[flancian]] sounds similar to [[nodes]]
            - [[chris aldrich]] lots of note taking tools are text based, and backing databases are non public / don't have URLs
                - #map deep linking and addressability is indeed about having a URL for each block even in those scenarios
                - [[web annotations]] use ranges, we could have the same for markdown
                - "xpath for markdown"
                    - +1
                    - web annotation targets for markdown
                - [[flancian]] what about wikilinks as anchors within notes?
                    - #map semantic ambiguity
                        - #flancian Not sure
                    - #map doesn't work in the general case as it's only controlled by the writer
                        - #flancian: fair
                        - #maparent look at at-json
                - 'this thing in this document at this time' -- [[memento protocol]] for example
                    - "memento protocol over massive wiki"
                    - could map to a git commit in the case of git backed repositories
                    - [[chris aldrich]] could be resolved via internet archive for the web in the general case when that is available
                    - [[maparent]] Actually used by web archive. See http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/about/
                - [[meta]] how do we track of 'interesting threads' like that above?
                    - [[peter kaminski]] what about a shared page?
                    - -> AI: create a document/repository location and designate it as first version of this :)
    - [[Peter Kaminski]]
            - [[Thinking Tools Map Project]] update
                - [[mathew lowry]] did a fair amount of work
                - some of our project work got out of sync but it's being merged
                - realization: we had not set up a way to do collaboration beforehand, both platform and convention level
                - -> [[massive wiki channel]] in [[ogm mattermost]]
                    - <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki>
                    - <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/nshenqwxxj8mbq1rptiddut96r>
                - collaborating over chat is relatively hard, threading is only basic
                - [[github issues]] and branches
                    - maybe a document workflow with comments would be lighterweight?
                    - Note: issues in git (vs github) with [GitBug](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug)
            - Looked again at Markdown parsers (particularly those that can create ASTs, because that's a sign of development organization and quality)
                - [remark](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/project/remarkjs/remark/) + [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) (JavaScript)
                - [mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe) (Python)
                    - [[flancian]] the Agora (Python) currently uses [[marko]], but mistletoe looks superior at first glance
                    - [[markdoc]] is an extended [[markdown]] syntax created/used by [[stripe]]
            - [[schema]]
                - [[people]] [[tools]] [[techniques]]
                - #map [[goals]] maybe as a separate category, or [[intent]]
                - maybe also [[audience]]
                - -> AI: add to threaded document.
            - Wishing there were typed links in Markdown
                - [[flancian]] in the Agora, links are typed/annotated by the preceding one (or tag)
                - @scalingsynthesis uses prefixes: https://anagora.org/@scalingsynthesis
                - [[chris aldrich]] [[microformats]] could be part of a link
                - #map [[yaml]] blocks could go anywhere?
                    - [[supertag]] syntax is growing on him
                    - see Gyuri's work on Trailmarks
        - [[sj]] - I think a good 80% solution for reconciling different types into a single namespace is to support [[TOPIC (qualifier)]], have it rendered while reading as just TOPIC, and have the link to [[TOPIC (qualifier)]] redirect to any of: "TOPIC", TOPIC (qualifier)", "TOPIC#qualifier" etc. which authority file can be updated by any editor of the markdown network (and may change as people take time to fill out nodes for increasingly specific variations on the topic).  
            - very similar to what i came to
    - [[flancian]] have been meaning to collect a list of repositories which we would like integrate into a shared construct (agora wink wink) -- do you have any?
        - [[peter kaminski]] massive wiki is agnostic w.r.t. versioning and sharing models (or tries to be)
            - for git, [[massive wiki]] can have submodules
            - [[massive wiki builder]] will build
        - do you have note repositories of your own, personal or otherwise?
            - [[peter kaminski]] have one but not currently shareable :)
            - AI: suggest we keep discussing this in future instances
                - [[sister sites]], sister pages
                - twin pages
                - interwiki
                - web rings :)
                - wiki [[collaboration primitives]]
                - Instant wikilinks / cascading wikisheets: implicit interwiki resolution (a la https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/InstantCommons) :: make the local .cws legible so you can see the order in which your current interface looks for matching nodes in choosing the default interwiki 
                    - try variation that chooses cascade order based on length/quality of target node
                    - try interface variation that shows top N options in asymmetric list/pie
                - [[fedwiki]] is brilliant but the feeling of the room is that we don't fully understand it
                    - is there people building any kind of business providing fedwiki widely/easily?
                    - https://byname.wiki.conversence.com
                - sj: update vocab to distinguish meki from wiki 
      - #map [[coauthor]] https://coauthor.conversence.com
    - Q: [[sj]] how to capture third-party cross-wiki page-name-maps?   e.g. say we read together a dozen sources, which are not generally world editable, and are building (in a shared space) interwiki links + merge requests across the set of pages in those sources.
        - [[maparent]] this is what I meant by "glue" earlier, it's a core [[HyperKnowledge]] goal
- AIs
    - AI: start a [[tracking document]] for tracking pending interesting threads
        - done -> [[fotl threads]]
    - AI: Then let's do a pass collecting all useful links we already have in this node and in [[fotl]] and move them to [[fotl threads]].
    - AI: Let's move communications over chat for the above projects to the [[fellowship of the link]] channel by default, or share links there to other sources of truth.
    - AI: let's discuss wiki [[collaboration primitives]] and the potential of integrating independent note taking repositories/wikis a la massive wiki / agora
    - AI: add schema section to [[fotl threads]]
    - AI: upload recording to some well known location :)
        - [[bentley]] suggest putting the raw file in drive first

    - [[Fermat]]
    - [[Tools for thought rocks]] https://lu.ma/tftrocks-oct22

    - what could we do with what we already know, even with an incomplete map?
    - [[marc antoine]] [[hyperknowledge maps]] https://hyperknowledge.org/HyperKnowledge.mp4
        - we want:
            - [[deep hyperlinks]]
            - deep [[anchoring]] (new, a la [[web annotations]])
            - many to many relationships between anchors and entities
        - [[flancian]] we probably want this second level map for projects that are trying to work on interlinking 
        - preconditions:
            - backlinks
            - supple many:many relationships between anchor text and meaning
        - [[agora]]
            - [[interlinking]]

        - [[maparent]] focusing on the differences:
            - [[deep backlinks]]
        - any single idea will be in millions of contexts, how to keep the graph "readable" 
        - attribution/degree of belief
            - surface surprising beliefs, beliefs that could be questioned
        - [[jerry michalski]] deck of patterns for cognitive biases
            - swipe right / swipe left? :)
        - [[jerry michalski]] real world example
            - half of the republicans running now *say* that the election was stolen
            - should this ideally disqualify them? 
            - #map ~ [[maparent]] we want to qualify belief by track record, e.g. the work of [[superforecasters]]
            - distinguish empty claims from testable claims
        - what's the minimum set of coordinated actions we could take to maximize the chances this great crowdsourcing effort happens?
            - hashtags/wikilinks as one way to coordinate -- but might not be enough?
            - [[chris aldrich]] the [[instagram problem]]
            - [[flancian]] the Agora tries to make it so that the community can cross-link oportunistically/share entities and auto link
            - [[maparent]] worried about ambiguity still regardless of whether they are autogenerated or human generated
        - [[chris aldrich]] on the recent controversy in US politics with racially charged comments by politicians

        - #map working on a plan and a prototype for [[hyperknowledge]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] how to push actors towards more precise speech (to counteract Trump's style of not saying anything but convincing some people he is aligned with them, even in the centre left initially)
        - two kinds of self organization:
            - self organization around a shared goal in a self-selected group
            - coordinated action in a very large scale

                        - (Looks like the publisher is https://exapt.press)
                        - Chris is likely dropping out

### Notes
- Introductions!
- [[jerry michalski]] ~ #jm
    - on previous calls
    - on sometimes having overlap in different dimensions but not having shared clarity/understanding
    - sharing clarity vs rambling
    - happens even at the organizational level when you're trying to set up a mission statement
        - [[motherhood statements]] ~ "we believe in X", "we believe in Y" -- but we're usually looking for nuggets of novelty
    - [[numenta]]
        - would like to jump into a "digested format"
        - [[prediction framework]]
            - as [[society of mind]]
- #push [[Gene]] and [[Jerry Michalski]] go way back

        - [[umberto eco]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czc_KjWji8E
        - [[library tours]]
- Spider chart example
    - reusable ethical services might be a competitive advantage of tools in the [[commons]]
    - commercial tools seem to have an advantage in the current market -- they get the backing of the market "leads" (VC, etc.) which lets them out-compete freer options
        - uber is not a [[fair marketplace]], yet it outcompeted more ethical alternatives
        - on the [[hypocrisy]] of "fake markets" -- platforms that behave like markets but are controlled by a single entity
            - #push [[fake markets]]
                - https://bra.in/8vBe4W
    - [[chris aldrich]] ~ #ca if we did [[spider graphs]], how do you select axis to focus on?
        - how do we present this information in a way that prioritizes the ethical aspect, and perhaps helps tool developers prioritize lacking dimensions?
        - #jm selecting dimensions in different contexts
        - #jm finding which tools are missing, which tools are complementary
            - "which tools play well with each other"
        - #ca another thing which is important to people in this space: even though [[obsidian]] is not open source, people find it easy to develop against it and it's got open source extensions
            - so it seems unlikely they will turn into a new Twitter
            - but even in that case it seems you could move to other players which are more open
    - [[bentley]] implemented [[filtering]] in [[spider graphs]] (demo)
    - #jm what is [[indieweb]]'s perspective on convincing people to build openly?
        - #ca #push [[indieweb]] they have built a structure on a two prong idea:
            - you own your own domain name
                - [[flancian]] ~ #f what about weakening this into "you own some URL space"
                - #ca it's possible, but at the end of the day you want to own what a URL resolves to
                - the ecosystem is developing in the direction of letting you redirect between domains
            - you have control over your data
            - #jm what about separating data from apps, e.g. storing on github?
                - as in, you map any new tool to the same existent dataset
                - #ca you can point tools in [[indieweb]] to repositories of data
                - #ca #push [[micropub]] is a spec; a "data plug board" that allows people to easily write apps that publish events to different consumers
                    - #go https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
                    - a post goes first to your website
                    - then the website has the know how on how to publish to feeds
                    - [[bookmark service]] is the [[hello world]] here
                - [[medium]] could rewrite its backend to support [[micropub]] and it would let you cross post to many other sites
                - #f how does this interact with [[activitypub]]?
                    - #ca it fits in this model but it's a steeper learning curve
                    - in most of the AP space, if you don't interop with [[mastodon]], you don't exist
                    - lots of tools target [[mastodon]] as it supports some core things well
                - [[aram zucker]]
                    - guide to [[activitypub]]: https://tinysubversions.com/notes/reading-activitypub/
                - #push [[fotl agenda]] 
                    - the field of [[x clone]] in the [[fediverse]]
                    - no single AP client that supports all features
                    - [[lemmy]] as an interesting example of new platform built on [[activitypub]]
                    - [[goodreads]] functionality
                        - #ca https://indieweb.org/personal_library#Silo_Examples
    - back to meta level here?
        - on mapping of the fediverse, of tools?
        - or [[spider charts]]
            - #f [[go/t4t radar]] points to the chart (- and + also work for spaces)
                - which categories do we want here?
                - linking articles to support scores/opinions
                - #f [[assertion feeds]]
                - #jm spreadsheet is easily embeddable to begin with
                - #ml publishing markdown/resources to repositories and sharing that
            - #f [[gardens]] and [[feeds]]? :)
            - #ml can we add domains/repositories to what is searching?
                - #f yes
            - [[aram zucker-scharff]] ~ [[az]]
            - #jm [[noosphere]]
            - #ca most of the big commercial offerings allow people to store data on [[dropbox]] or [[google drive]]
                - [[agora]] could enable people to move from [[dropbox]] to [[git]] based workflows
                - micropub spec ostensibly could be used for moving from platform [[x]] to platform [[y]]

### Agenda 
- [[2022-08-19]]: recap of Render Conference for Tools for Thinking https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking
    - done!

### Notes
- [[jerry michalski]]
    - [[render]] ~ [[tools for thinking]]
- [[flancian]]
    - great introduction
    - great conversation with [[howard rheingold]]
    - amazing announcement by [[gordon brander]]: [[noosphere]]
        - it is [[an agora]], done very well!
- [[jerry michalski]] welcomes [[dan whaley]]!
  - [[dan whaley]]
      - Fridays are much better meeting wise!
      - very busy but 
      - [[14 million dollars]] investment from [[ithaka]] and [[jstor]] https://web.hypothes.is/blog/say-hello-to-anno/
  - how does this interact with the global [[knowledge commons]]?
      - [[annotations]] -> the knowledge is in the annotation you take
      - but the annotation is layered on preexisting on knowledge
      - it's about protocols and things but also about seeding [[communities]]
  - [[hypothesis]] cares about the user having access to the underlying knowledge
      - regardless of whether it's because it's free or they happen to have (exclusive?) access
      - this knowledge could be resolved in a federated network
          - clients using open protocols like [[web annotations]] can participate in this network
      - [[flancian]] how does this relate to [[markets]]?
          - and the fairness of said markets.
          - IMHO [[commons]] should [[embed]] markets
          - [[dan whaley]] the knowledge is what's "out there" right now, we try to pass no judgment and support the existing models
              - most universities have access to [[json]], but most others don't
              - the [[nyt]] is not free
                  - > paywalls
              - some content might always be gated
              - the world may be moving towards [[free access]] but that will happen on its own terms?
              - [[hypothesis]] thinks there's a sustainable path for them; charging for institutional usage maybe but making the conversation available to everybody
                  - not doing ads
                      - -> [[reality distortion matrix]]
                      - silos trying to [[monetize attention]]
                  - constructive ways of funding
                  - open [[saas]]
       - [[mathew lowry]] have you watched [[render]] / [[tools for thinking]]
           - [[dan whaley]] not yet!
           - [[mathew lowry]] interesting ai potential exploration
           - what are your thoughts on integrating AI with hypothesis?
               - "here is what your friends think about X in the web" vs "here is what an AI thinks about X in the web"
               - [[dan whaley]]
                   - AI is super interesting as created by humans for humans
                   - a force for good to help us navigate the world more powerfully
                   - but of course there are negative use cases, so we need to set the right incentives
               - [[flancian]]
                   - may not there be a difference in the long term? :)
               - in terms of influencing AI
                   - (... saw something in chat :))
               - mathew: valuable content layered on top of layered content.
                   - -> sentiment analysis and meta sentiment analysis
                   - people benefiting from the AI they train instead of the current status quo
               - [[dan whaley]] very privileged to have access to this data, and to steer a new paradigm
                   - find revenues that can sustain this while being pro social is critical
                   - only will explore what will be beneficial
               - [[jerry michalski]]
                   - [[douglas tomkins]] (sp?) and [[x]] from [[patagonia]]
                   - building land tracts and are trying to turn it into a trust
                       - (!)
                   - is there one ambitious funding project that could be explored for maximum benefit here?
                   - could we fund the [[idea commons]] on some large, ambitious scale?
                       - [[flancian]] using the commons, regulating markets, to disrupt the market for public good
                   - [[dan whaley]] what is the change we want to make?
                       - you could imagine all kinds of things
                           - one idea: how could you incentivize people to make annotations professionally?
                           - meaning high quality "trailblazers"
                           - proposed legislation
                           - pre annotating bills!
                           - what would it take to be able to fund this
                       - concept of [[reddit gold]]
                           - chip in to providing high quality contributions?
                       - fixing the [[newspaper subcription model]]
                           - you put 10 bucks in, it goes to the authors of the things you read
                           - [[jerry michalski]] reinventing [[xanadu]] in a way
                       - [[jerry michalski]]
                           - the large pot of money (a risk in itself, but) can be distributed
                           - [[dan whaley]] it's a flow
                           - like mycellian nutrients
                           - [[flancian]] meta on the metaphor
                           - [[chris aldrich]] [[redwood trees]] network roots to be able to stand up taller
                               - for most trees, they tend to be mirror images
                               - not so redwoods
                       - [[data trust]]
                         - [[chris aldrich]] how to get good quality data in general  
                             - [[twitter]] is already a great repository of annotations in a sense, but you have to sift through a lot more stuff to go to the gems
                             - [[jerry michalski]] [[nugget ratio]] is very high if you curate your follows
                             - [[flancian]] -> the [[social network]] is what encodes the most information
                                 - the importance of [[open ranking]], [[open filtering]], [[open algorithms]] -> [[open ais]]
                             - [[jerry michalski]] why are [[tools for conversation]] not [[tools for thinking]]?
                                 - the lack of good permalinks in interesting answers in random forums
                                     - walled gardens
                                 - one of the nice things about hypothes.is is that it's got a great signal to noise ratio and you can easily link to full contexts
                             - [[indieweb]] is important here
                             - [[mathew lowry]] [[myhub]] is part of [[indieweb]]
                                 - on the following relationship
                                 - as leading to flows -> (of attention, of funding)
                             - [[flancian]] hypothes.is integrations with [[feeds]]? it already provides feeds, how important they seem to you
                                 - [[dan whaley]] we provide feeds but are not currently looking at providing more
                                 - focusing on providing arbitrary annotation for arbitrary web resources
                             - [[chris aldrich]] how do you also not aggregate streams only, but how do you turn those feeds into something feedin a [[garden]]
                                 - [[how to feed the garden]]
                                 - [[robin sloan]] (...) (sp?)

### Notes
Jerry's brain for this session: https://bra.in/6p63ZP

- [[betaworks]] conference: https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking
- [[Mathew Lowry]]
    - WordPress plugin to syndicate news orgs from multiple sites of different languages 
    - Would be useful to give publishers more to cite and a better understanding  
    - A type of shared memory 
    - Hard to get journalists to adopt the tool
    - A bunch of different organizations sharing the tools for mutral benifit. 
    - From Mattermost - https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/gbonf7z177yquffqz59mu8uino :
        - The basic idea was to create CMS plug-ins for newsrooms which would allow journalists in different participating newsrooms to access each other's content, both published and otherwise (ie, drafts, notes, etc.), via their CMS. The  participating newsrooms essentially become a sort of decentralised press agency. This is particularly interesting in Europe, where every newsroom cannot have a journalist in every country. Hence the system would incorporate machine translation, autocategorisation and autosummary. Obviously, every time newsroom A used newsroom B's content - ie A translated and republished B's article into their own language for their own audience - newsroom B would earn credit. And every time B used A's, they would spend that credit.
        - This is a very specific use case, with a business model, for decentralised sharing. And the social benefit is real, because it would set up a decentralised alternative to the big press agencies and allow stories which they will never pick up to travel across borders and find new audiences.

- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - https://restofworld.org/ 
    - Old version of [[Zemanta]]
        - A blog post "enhanced" by Zemanta https://hacktext.com/2011/02/what-is-a-text-and-how-do-i-hack-it-521/

- Potential space for this [[WordCamp for Publishers]] https://twitter.com/wcpublishers/
    - Great event, highly recommend! - Aram
- There's the https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/ that is really great. 
- Chris
    - The NYT has a digital archive team of about 3
    - Photos are not fully backed up there
    - 2 decades of working on the problem and not everything is backed up. 
- Mathew
    - The European Commission relies on the Internet Archive for websites they no longer wish to maintain. 
- Jerry
    - YouTube has its own storage problems stuff is not well archived. It is remarkable that they even capture what they can. 
    - The future digital anthropoligsts what will they find?
- Aram
    - Archiving should be something anyone can do and have on their own site 
    - Just like [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) there should also be link once and archive yourself 
    - These systems should be able to talk to each other and share and replicate their resources
- Jerry
    - How does this survive though? My hard drives don't survive me 
- Chris
    - We have this problem with music - we saw how a lot of that music got lost.
    - Tip of the iceburg - so much history is lost 
    - music notation didn't exist in printed forms until about 11th century
- Jerry
    - In Small Things Forgotten 
    - Gravestones are very useful for history. Also potery. 
    - Tiny differences in gravestones over time are fashion trends that are time indicators. 
- Aram
    - I think in terms of preservation we can look at Activity Pub. When you federate with another server it pulls and replicates and distrubutes stuff. It would be great if we could get that done with archives. 
    - Open sourcing is good as well
- Mathew 
    - If you link to something you automatically make a backup is a good idea
    - What does this have to do with content sharing? 
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage
        - http://open-content.net/caw
        - One peice of content can be shared out replicated and shares an address across many locations.
- Smallest Federated Wiki 
- IPFS but pinning is an issue. 
- Collective intellegence - what that means for spread and maintenance 
- Songlines Are the Original Blockchain - https://bra.in/5jQYgm
- Jerry
    - A lot of ways of remembering were intentionally destroyed by colonization 
    - [[Songlines]] are an example of that
    - but it turns out that these ways of handling it are important.
    - Local populations carefully crafting things and being overwritten by colonization. 
- The Biggest Estate on Earth: How the Aborigines Made Australia (2011) 
- Chris
    - [[David Christian]] on [[collective intelligence]]: The beginning of collective knowledge and intellegence as the marker for the beginning of human history. 
-  Jerry
    - Christian talked about how there are not hooks in the work to be able to pull his data out of his finished thesis. 
    - Humans are really good at killing themselves off and then passed down the ways they learned not to. 
- How practices spread and disceminate? 
- We overvalue the written world - Jerry. 
- Mathew
    - An overvalue of memorization 
    - Greeks overvalued it and that was the end point of oral learning. 
- What does a non-literary method look like here? 
- Aram:
    - [Queens Memory](https://queensmemory.org/) - Podcasts as a method of oral history 
    - Memes and emoji as inconographic languages 
- Jerry
    - There are others as well like NPR's project here that do podcasts for oral histories 
    - [[The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image]] (1998) 
- Aram
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis
- Chris
    - Interesting project to 'write' coreography in a way that isn't the standard way of transmitting coreography
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_notation
    - Different ways to lay out colors an images to annotate video - how could you have a recorded record that could be used to recreate a movie from the notes. 
- Graphic facilitators 
- Mathew
    - volcano model for desktop information - starts in the center and slowly flows towards the sides until it falls off the desktop. 
- Aram
    - Reminds me of 3d desktops
        - ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_43742f2c6167180e0f75a72217f54e4e.png)
- Jerry
    - [[Songlines]] on the desktop 
    - Grapiphic facilitation at conferences 
    - Point back at stuff that was written on the wall from a previous day. 
    - What would The Brain look like as the file system for an operating system. 
    - synecure
- Aram
    - Archiving as a regular personal practice 
- Chris
    - References of people who value their knowledge so they protect against it being lost to history. 
        - These bound books over here with all my notes take them out of the house 
- Jerry
    - Tools for thinking - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/4bfe6526-9884-4b6d-9548-23659da7811e/ 
- https://scalingsynthesis.com/
- Scaling Synthesis - Multiplayer TFT https://lu.ma/9a21amd7 from 2022-08-09 video should be available shortly from [[Boris Mann]] et al.
- Should we write a database of these things or should we poll people and publish interviews? What tools do people recommend?
    - Good example: https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book 
    - Would be good to hear from people: 
        - I have this practice 
        - this  is how I use it 
        - this is what it looks like 
        - and this is how I turn it into outputs? 
    - Looking at how people use their information graphs and how they visualize information 
    - It would be really valuable to me to know if I want a good graph this is what it looks like 
    - Why isn't there more documentation of these tools and how could it lead to interoperability 
- Chris
    - Even the history of the tree space isn't as well known or broadly distributed.... 
    - Lima, Manuel. [[The Book of Trees]]: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, 2014. 
        - https://papress.com/products/the-book-of-trees-visualizing-branches-of-knowledge 
        - Jerry: in my brain - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/cff5e4d0-94af-70a0-d710-d324cbdd55e6/ 
- Jerry
    - Could we have a [[pattern language]] for this? 
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language
    - Ex: Light from Two Walls can become a shorthand for talking about loose rules that trigger understand and contextualization. 
    - Ex: [[1 2 4 all]]
        - [Jerry write up of instrumenting](https://wiki.rel8.dev/tile_-_1-2-4-all_zoom_app)
- Mathew
    - Is there a syntax or thesouras for pattern languages
- Jerry
    - Patern Languages of Pattern Languages
        - https://www.hillside.net/plop/2022/ 
    - Chatbots maybe a solution?
        - Hey I'm intersted in Starting with Tools for Thinking
- Aram
    - Maybe just a question and answer page?
- Jerry
    - And then you could feed it into a Chat Bot
- Mathew
    - How do we help people find the right tool for them
    - How do we help people find the right pattern langugage for them. 
- Aram
    - It seem swe have to interview people first and get them to talk us through it. 
    - Do we need a questionaire? 
- Jerry
    - a smorgasbord of thinking tool users' preferences
    - There is some skill required to pull people out of their over-complexity.
- [ ] questionnaire for thinking tool users? 
    - What are you using this tool for and why? 
    - What did you wish your tool suite did? 
    - In the note taking space a lot of people don't think out the longg term value 
    - Creating one or two notes a day over a year before the big affordances become obvious 
    - what is the long term value of your tool suite and process? 
    - create a 3 minute video of your most typical use case 
        - UX Studies Practice here ?
            - Narrate yourself through the proceess and what you are thinking 
- Chris
    - Very few people get to the 3 or 4 month mark where they see pay off from notetaking.
    - Not many people are writing about it as a benefit either. 
- Mathew
    - We need to use the 5 why technique - we need to ask why a lot
    - Not everyone wants to use notes for creation, some are just collectors. 
- Chris
    - Some people have collect a lot of stuff as the only goal and then the assumption is that [[note taking magic]] happens, but that isn't really the case. 
- People find a system and then want to sell it and that can be a problem
    - [[GTD]] aka [[getting things done]] is an example here
    - [[nick milo]] and [[linking your thinking]] https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/
- [[Memory]] and [[major system]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system as a historical example of people selling intellectual systems or frameworks. This is playing itself out again with note taking tools.

    - [[betaworks]] render event next week about [[tools for thought]] [[2022-08-16]]
        - [[nyc]]
        - https://render.betaworks.com/thinkcamp-a-betaworks-accelerator-program-for-tools-for-thinking-de7e18bf5682
    - how to get a [[posse]] working together
    - [[chorus of voices]]
- [[internet slowness]]
    - [[van jacobson]]
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson_TCP/IP_Header_Compression
- on [[conventions]]
    - [[lower caps]] vs [[initial caps]]
        - eventual fixup
        - eventual convergence :)
    - inclusivity aspect of it: be liberal w.r.t. what you take
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] myhub does the same, lowercase by default everywhere. Based on my (poor) experience with Roam.
    - arguments for/against
        - [[lower caps]]
        - [[initial caps]]
            - more readable
            - the cost of writing caps is helped by tools like [[obsidian]] auto completing links once you type \[\[
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] about unicode coalescing (there's a better word for this) in both directions, pros and cons
            - (...)
            - very used to writing in caps anyway
            - ex: platforms like instagram show how people "exploit" hashtags by using many similar ones to have greater reach
            - a platform could actually coalesce hashtags
                - [[triangle thinking]] ~ [[combinatorial creativity]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] operationalizing communal note taking in preparation for [[betaworks]]
    - how do you do note taking?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] almost on git but not currently
            - most of the public stuff starts in [[hypothes.is]]
            - notes in hypothes.is have permalinks
                - actually have two URLs:
                    - one for the page/resource you annotated followed by a trigger for hypothes.is to open and show the annotation in context
                    - one in the hypothes.is domain which refers to the actual annotation proper
                    - "[[js;dr]] problem"
                - [[Jerry Michalski]]
                    - you can share a highlight to a passage using the current #... convention
                - https://indieweb.org/media_fragment (thanks!)
                - https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/
                - hypothes.is reads the tags and uses it for presenting annotations/highlights
                - https://www.w3.org/annotation/
                - https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/

    - #push [[how people think]]
        - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/think/
    - how could we bridge these numbered 1 .. 17 aspects with:
        - notes about the same in other note taking systems
        - hypothes.is annotations on those sections
    - [[mathew lowry]] which level of granularity do you use for your notes? resource/concept/etc. 
        - how to map one to the other?
        - [[jerry michalski]] call this the [[nugget problem]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] [[nugget size]] vs [[zoom levels]]
        - [[jerry michalski]]

            - Q: is there typing in [[thebrain]] or some other way to distinguish nuggets from e.g. full resources?
                - it could encode this but the way Jerry uses it loses this information
                - Jerry does not use some features just because they slow him down / they take a lot of time
                - [[Mark Trexler]] uses more of these features and is a [[climate change]] expert.
            - [[chris aldrich]] the labels/wikilinks that you used for these are unlikely to be the same other people use.
                - (but once these are known to all be in a particular resource...)

                        - [[chris aldrich]] creating [[red links]] (in wiki terms), it would be nice to be able to get resolution paths whenever one is clicked (resolve this in X, Y or Z)
                        - [[jerry michalski]] the autocomplete in obsidian could be extended to resolve in expanding circles

            - cloud means private
        - but there's many views that make sense for different context, different people
        - the all singing, all dancing platform lets you choose your own view based on what you need and shift between them
        - how to solve this?
            - [[flancian]] assume it will work and then make it work :)
                - gather resources of many different types/mental models, all about the same entity/event/thing
                - then try to make them coalesce and translate between each other
            - [[chris aldrich]] solving the general problem is hard, start with subproblems

### Notes
Jerry's brainf for this meeting: https://bra.in/7j3ewE

- [[Anagora]] shared notes 
- #push [[Commonplace books]]
    - Passed down
    - Example: [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s was left to his family. [[Charles Darwin]] used it and passed it down; it's now in a library
    - Easier to do now on the web while active, harder to preserve 
        - https://indieweb.org/longevity
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - Context.center 
        - [Timelines at work](https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-timelines/) - I find timelines to be really useful on understanding and progressing things and finding pattersn and understanding causes.
    - Logging git work and developing in public to make reference easier. 
        - [[Paul Frazee]] - works on [[Beaker]] and other [[Hyper]] projects. 
            - Really cool logging of code work linked with live streaming -  https://paulfrazee.medium.com/building-in-the-open-70ac9dccf1aa 
        - fightwithtools.dev - stream of thought developer notes linked to git commits (still in progress). Trying to make my work more approachable. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]]: What about [[Spaced Repetition]]
    - [[mnemonic medium]]
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/6900f8c3-d117-94dc-4996-39241bd989e0/ 
    - Chris Aldrich: [Piotr Wo≈∫niak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher))
    - [[mnemonic reading]]
    - [[Anki]] https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 
    - Duolingo
    - A useful version of this is active notetaking while reading articles - perhaps combined
        - Refrence to Genius and other web highlighting/note-taking layers that exist 
    - [[Soren Bjornstad]] formerly of Anki and now at Remnote has lots of work on spaced repetition https://www.sorenbjornstad.com/writing/ 
    - [[David Weinberger]] [[automated summarization]] could play a role here? 
    - [[Mathew Lowry]]: Something I want to add to MyHub
        - Imagine you are creating another piece of content in the same zone - remember you asked this question to yourself 5 months ago?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: Recently worked on a timeline learning tool - where you get a package of articles in a timeline and it tracks your reading of each article. I wonder if it works with the automated summization content to create learning cards?
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: It might be interesting to see about giving people different orders of articles than just date saved, that they store so they can build narratives out of those cards. 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: You can pull date from metadata btw. Also: Narrative creation by ordering cards is really interesting. One example of this is Will Wright's tool for Current TV - https://hacktext.com/2011/02/crowd-sourced-television-goes-to-the-next-level-with-bar-karma-and-storymaker-477/
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Founder of https://redforester.com/ is working on something similar that takes elements and can organize them in different ways. I recommended animation to different forks. 
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: Taking notes then reviewing them - asking yourself a question that forces you to produce an answer is a far better method of review that simply re-reading material. Example: [[Cornell Notes]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes 
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Five Rs of Note Taking: 
        - Recite
        - Record
        - Reduce
        - Reflect
        - Review 
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: Do you have a set of pre-generated questions that you can slot specific things into or is it more freeform? (To Chris)
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: [[Cloze]] process where, when you are writing it/taking up the notes you use brackets that mean you are already writing the card. 
        - Have to make sure the questions are not too open ended. 
        - Usually one or two sentences with only a few things missing. 
        - I use it very sparingly because I have other methods I prefer to [[Spaced Repetition]]
        - Actively linking notes also helps a great deal. 
    - book: Memory Craft: Improve Your Memory with the Most Powerful Methods in History (2019) by [[Lynne Kelly]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] AR projects seem to lack informational, helper, curational stuff. 
- Useful concept memory palaces: loci
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci
- [[David Weinberger]] 
    - background in philosophy 
    - for past 30 years writing about the ways in which technology effects the ways we think about things. Focused on Machine Learning for the past 5 years. 
    - Working at Google on Ethics and AI
- [[David Weinberger]] - Writing Notes Process
    - Hobbyist programmer
    - Wrote app that lets me take notes in plain old [[ascii]] (text)
    - bibliographic info at top
        - page number, note and tag
    - took notes on a ton of info that way
    - then built an app that let me shunt it all into databases 
    - Went back to Zotero yesterday
        - Couldn't get it to work and it doesn't work the way I want it to. 
    - [yes](https:yes.com) 
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] 
    - I liked [[Endnote]] when someone else was paying for it. 
    - [[Zotero]] is great, not for me really because I'm no longer an academic, but lots of great ways to plug in to it to make it for me.
    - For arguing on the web, that's what I use context.center for. 
- [[Chris Aldrich]]: 
    - Mendeley seems to be shutting down
    - Zotero is useful for annotating PDFs and now does export of notes from .pdfs as of version 6.0
- [[Jerry Michalski]] big charts and zooming in and out of them is one of the problems we need to take on. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]] 
    - [[Harvard Growth Lab]] has an amazing infographic about economics
        - https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/
- Reminds me of - https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder
- [[Cesar Hidalgo]] - https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/
- What do we take on next? Agenda for next week:
    - How to explain the shared memory concept? 
    - A lot of different answers. 
    - Maybe understanding what the technical format is for a "memory" so it can be shared effectively. 
- Where are the YouTube listings of our calls?
    - In Jerry's brain 
    - In the Mattermost chat 

### Action items / #TODO

- [ ] invite others
    - who?
    - if we write it down in a canonical place we can distribute this (useful, social) work
- [ ] set up cross-review?
    - [[flancian]] would be willing and glad to review other people's writing, perhaps we could do this as a group?
        - full disclosure: I'm also writing a chapter :)
        - Always glad to read and make suggestions! - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
- What else might we publish? Potentially on the site
- [ ] [[let's share notes]]
    - [ ] start integrating pattern languages
        - [ ] build a [[meta pattern language]]

- Formats and protocols to exchange and connect knowledge 
    - [[flancian]] thinks of Anagora as a reference implementation of [[agora protocol]], which is this protocol
    - What are the standard objects that move back and forth on this protocol? What is the shapes and how can they enable information exchange and connection? 
        - Does this connect with ActivityPub? Could we send objects and federate "brains" in this way?

### Notes
- Where to track a recurring agenda/our goals?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] something that has worked for indieweb is having people who join show a token of interest; e.g. try to improve something for someone
        - i.e. we can talk all day, but improvements to real systems are what we should be shooting towards
        - we could focus here on integrating systems that already exist (the ones we're building or fostering individually) as a group
    - [[flancian]] let's try to spot patterns (...)
- [[aram zucker-scharff]]
    - works for the [[The Washington Post]]

    - [[zettelkasten]], [[commonplace books]], [[tools for thought]], [[personal knowledge graphs]], [[interlays]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] lots of projects in this space are trying to sell something; but we care most about the [[commons]]
    - how do we take idea capturing and generating and link them into a healthy [[knowledge commons]]?
- [[logseq]] model as it relates to the commons
    - taking VC money seems slightly worrying as they'll want to be repayed
    - https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
    - [[logseq]] looks close to [[obsidian]]
        - do we have enough variety of approaches?
    - paying for services is fine
- [[you need a wiki]]
- [[agenda]]
    - #push [[rel8]]
        - https://wiki.rel8.dev
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[rel8 pioneers]]
    - [[flancian]] let's all push our projects onto a shared space and talk by default about interlinking and integrating them?
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] let's start a list of resources and repositories? 
        - this may help to bootstrap a [[commons]]
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[mycelium]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]]

- let's bring to the next meeting -- a list of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- [[affordances]]
    - [[wikilinks]] and [[metadata]] as key to the [[commons]]
- [[meta]] about chat
    - let's prefer the [[mattermost]] to [[jitsi chat]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] what's the difference between [[indieweb]] vs [[fediverse]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is a subset of [[indieweb]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[indieweb]] is based around the notion of having your own website and building your identity around it
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is based around the notion of your identity being hosted in an instance like [[mastodon.social]]
 
 - Let's discuss what we wrote to [[rel8]], our lists of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- People who need access to the repo (github usernames):
    - flancian
    - aramzs
    - bouncepaw
    - chrisaldrich
    - mathewlowry
- Let's talk about [[search engines]]
    - https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/2022-07-02-projviding-meaningful-search-results-without-own-index.html 
    - [[queries as addresses]]
- Phone service vs Internet service analogy: https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
- Let's onboard everybody to the [[fediverse]]!
    - [[mastodon]] app is actually good to bootstrap/choose an instance
- Dump your ActivityPub IDs here ;)
    - @flancian@social.coop
    - @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com
    - @bouncepaw@lor.sh 
- What do we see as our long term goal?
    - [[flancian]] let's integrate repositories and tools and write [[science fiction]] together :) how could our tools, platforms, the internet, the world at large look like by [[2025]], [[2030]]?
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] is focusing on producing the [[pkg book]] chapter and would love to do research and writing in this space
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] would like to participate in exploration and prototyping; illustrate and broadcast interesting ideas for others to pick up; analyze what it will take to deliver this by the next decade; organize activities
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] appreciate the idea of [[shared wikis]] that can communicate back and forth with each other
        - [[flancian]] we should invite [[ward cunningham]]!

### Notes
- [[Jerry Michalski]] 
    - #push [[rel8]] 
        - #go https://www.rel8.dev
            - (a [[google site]])
            - https://www.rel8.dev/wiki is embedded above
        - "relating ideas, documents, perspectives and people"
    - (Jerry is using [[obsidian]] plus [[obsidian sync]] for this)
    - [[short term]], [[medium term]] and [[long term]] goals for [[rel8]]
    - [[short term]]
        - define: how do we share notes?
        - import [[jerry's brain]] from [[json]] into [[obsidian]] and [[excalidraw]]
            - [[Zsolt Viczi√°n]] (https://www.zsolt.blog/) is interested in doing this
        - what do we put on [[rel8]]?
            - a list of formats/processes that are sufficient for us to 'store our brain' comfortably?
            - [[Mathew Lowry]] user requirements exercise
        - [[flancian]] on a hub architecture for integrating brains and negotiating exchange (format conversion)
            - [[underlay]], [[interlay]], [[overlay]] as per [[metasj]]
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] decentralized or centralized?
            - decentralized is the idea (or distributed)
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] what should we be using as way of standards to create this?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] text -> markdown -> html
            - (shared by default is convenient but can be problematic)
            - text as the basic standard
            - then add links, e.g. markdown or org mode
            - then html, microformats, json, yaml can be layered on top
            - exchanged p2p (distributed) or via hubs
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] interested on web mentions, fediverse as they exist in the data exchange ecosystem
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] how can you design a minimum building block that is interoperable with other pieces?
            - [[web mentions]] takes the older ideas of pingback/trackback, strips them down to the essentials. it's a notification system via [[post]] requests.
            - [[mastodon]] could support web mentions (there was talk about this a few years back)
            - if X writes a post about URL A by Y, Y will be pinged
            - Y receives the notification, can do some spot checks (does the call refer to a post that actually has the expected link), and then does whatever it wants with it
            - [[activitypub]] could take advantage of [[webmentions]] as a building block, but it mostly doesn't
                - [[kevin marks]] (sp?) added microformats to [[mastodon]]
       - [[flancian]] decentralized vs distributed approach, web3 and all
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] technical details vs ease of use
       - [[flancian]] two directions we could go in:
           - text as the standard makes it easy to use actually as users can write text wherever they want, a priori
           - focusing on making existing tools and ecosystems easier to use/onboard to
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - high tech skills: you set up your own mastodon instance, agora, etc.
           - medium: you produce information, content but someone else pays the [[admin tax]] (you contribute to an instance)
           - (spectrum)
           - no technical expertise
           - #push [[blot im]] is very useful, imports from whenever you want
               - [[flancian]] nice, and it's open source: https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot
               - wanted to do this for the Agora so this is super helpful
       - [[Mathew Lowry]]
           - who are we building this for?
           - "instagram user" might be too wide a net?
           - disconnect from building a knowledge graph and writing for others
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
       - #push [[nuggets, remedies and pov]]
           - [[nuggetization]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related
       - [[public]] vs [[private]] as a default
           - [[public]] as default seems better to seemingly most of us
       - [[Chris Aldrich]] mostly these days notes start in [[hypothes.is]]
           - periodically gets feedback about how cool it is to work in public
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[fedwiki]]
           - [[twitter]] user 509 here (!)
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - going back to what we have in mind and where our ideas overlap
           - not really sure what he's expecting here, but a tool that would be interesting would be like this:
               - like the agora, where you could see it from two different perspectives
                   - as a personal tool, where an individual user decides which graphs converge on the agora
                   - "mix and match" feeds and gardens, an aggregator
                   - like an [[agora view]]
               - another agora is closer to anagora.org, where you push many graphs to a place but where the owners of the repos decided that in advance
           - an extension or tool could be written so that the nodes you see could be actual URLs, and incoming/outgoing links would be those around your internet context (social graph, feeds)
           - [[Jerry Michalski]]
               - [[apple's]] [[knowledge navigator]] video back in 1986
       - [[adversarial interoperability]]

           - [[Mathew Lowry]] [[mysilio]]
       - [[myhub]]
           - writing aids to get from notes to defined outputs
       - [[having a somewhere]]
           - [[knowledge contexts]] as a service
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - [[writing toolkit]]
           - #push [[social reader]] tracks, breaks down and integrates feeds
               - #go https://indieweb.org/social_reader
           - https://indieweb.org/Microsub
           - [[micro.blog]] is great
           - [[refbacks]]
               - https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2QvtE9w5zs49x7WUeG8Ut1vywHDLiG2Wkm9p pinged his site
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
           - [[intimacy gradient]] is a pattern in [[a pattern language]]
           - [[the view master]]
               - how do we generalize and integrate the superpowers that each tool gives?
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - would like to highlight the link aspect of how information pieces relate to each other
           - which links are mentioned in that tweet, that post?
           - about the [[great fungus]]
               - still thinking of this as an individual app customized by the user
               - [[personalized fungus]]? [[fungus view]]
- [[minimum viable formats]]
    - text
    - diagrams
- [[goals]]
    - define our [[wheres]] (from [[having a somewhere]])
        - [[the big fungus]]
        - [[agora]]
    - define minimum viable formats for storing our brains

        - [[diego de la hera]]
        - there is an extension that makes them worked well together
        - how does the community moderate annotations?
        - [[flancian]] default: the site sets the default ranking function for annotations. and perhaps some annotations are community owned, wiki like?

## 2022-06-09
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Inviting others
    - [[flancian]] been inviting people already, but would be like to use some kind of policy?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] suggest to use the Mattermost to coordinate; use this space to consider together our goals and attract others like this
       - [[mattermost]] https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-fellowship-of-the-link
    - let's use the list of people in the [[doc]] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAourQe_MKh0uWomLsS_V5ea3zm30g8paE49X56jIHs/edit
        - to brainstorm on who to invite if you want to discuss a priori
    - [[flancian]] invited Dan because of his interested in the space + his experience with web standards
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[web]] https://www.fellowshipofthelink.org/
    - who wants admin? :)
        - 0@flancia.org
        - delahera@gmail.com
        - christopherjaldrich@gmail.com
    - we could also start groups in social networks, e.g. linkedin
        - [[flancian]] [[mastodon]]?
        - got stuck in [[choosing an instance]]
            - [[diego de la hera]] mastodon.social could be seen as the default
            - (instance delegation could be interesting, web of trust like)
            - http://www.unmung.com/mastoview is a tool for helping to choose Mastondon instances
        - [[diego de la hera]] lack of defaults as a hindrance to adoption here, in the indieweb as well
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[barry schwartz]] https://bra.in/4jXVP2
            - [[the tyranny of choice]]
            - [[schelling point]]
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] with more choice you usually get increasing complexity
            - you are given so much choice it's almost too much (in the indieweb)
            - [[Jerry Michalski]] templates, walkthroughs add a lot of value
            - [[Chris Aldrich]] you need either a lot of time or people motivated because they're building business
            - [[peter kaminski]] introduced [[Jerry Michalski]] to [[obsidian]]
            - on straightforward vs powerful tools
            - [[diego de la hera]] on the power of forks
                - e.g. [[Chris Aldrich]]'s setup is something we could fork to bootstrap a new user's environment
                - people have copy/pasted Chris's website already, full pages at a time :)
       - [[flancian]] [[map of the fediverse]]
- longer term goals / brainstorming / dream sharing
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]
        - series of projects revolving around these issues
            - [[open global mind]], started 2y ago
                - part of a [[flotilla]] with other organizations
                - 8am pacific, standing call for [[ogm]]
            - [[rel8]]
                - why is it so hard to share, integrate notes -- build arguments?
                    - -> [[argument mapping]]?
                    - [[argumentation theory]]
                    - [[stephen toulmin]] -> [[toulmin model of argument]]
                - [[the big fungus]] == https://thebigfungus.org
                - interested in the scaffolding, infrastructure to share ideas
            - [[think camp]] funds startups in this space
                - "profitable businesses that feed the [[commons]]"
        - read an interesting article today, conservative point of view with good arguments even though some disagreeable premises
            - how do we put this article up to scrutiny and learn from it together?
                - -> [[web annotations]]?
                - [[gyuri lajos]]
                    - **[[Jerry Michalski]] let's have a group sync with Gyuri?**
                    - [[Chris Aldrich]] trails are related to [[vannevar bush]]'s
        - wishlist for [[fotl]]: how do these parts fit together?
            - how do we make it so that our notes provide maximum utility, spread through the big fungus
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] would like to focus on how to
        - make it all work together
        - make the systems be easy to use
        - make something that is as simple to understand as facebook?
        - I'd like to see [[commonplace books]] that can "talk" to each other.
        - "the [[stream]] flows by too fast"
            - turning streams into gardens
            - [[neil]] from the Agora has great writing on streams vs gardens, how they relate to each other - https://doubleloop.net/
- [[john borthwick]] at [[betaworks]] has funding for small projects [[think camp]]
- Watch parties
    - [[connection series]]
        - watch these, take notes/diagrams and share/interop
        - -> [[books, paintings, movies, ideas that shaped many people's lives]]
            - https://bra.in/5pxdW6
    - [[dan whaley]] youtube annotations are a side project / hobby
        - [[docdrop]] https://docdrop.org/
- [[diego de la hera]]
    - web annotations were mentioned; thought of two connections
        - [[peter hagen]] -> [[lindylearn]] https://lindylearn.io/ and specifically https://annotations.lindylearn.io/new/
            - social platform where you would find what other people are annotating and join the conversation
            - provides a discovery layer for what others are reading and thinking about
        - [[chrome]] is also tackling annotations
        - [[worldbrain]], [[memex]]?
        - it seems like here we want to work more on the level of how to connect different annotation tools at a (federated?) layer
            - perhaps what we need is an integration device at this layer, e.g. [[wikilinks]]

- ([[Chris Aldrich]] joined, introductions)
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]
        - [[the brain]]
        - [[chris]] any shares in the company?
        - not anymore
        - do you have backups?
        - occasionally :) but the format is a big bag of [[json]] objects, not bery interoperable
            - wishlist: [[open global mind]] platform instead
    - [[diego de la hera]]
        - hypothes.is user, contributor as the maintainer of the unofficial extension for firefox; working with [[wikimedia foundation]]
        - met Chris through hypothes.is
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]
        - background: biomedical and electrical engineer, been on the web since the early 90s
        - [[indieweb]] / https://indieweb.org
        - [[open web backup]], strong belief in owning your own domain, your own data, your own identity
        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[Jerry Michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space
    - it should allow all users to view data through their chosen tools
    - sometimes you change tools as you shift what you need to do (they are good at different modes of thinking)
    - [[planes]]
        - [[multi plane camera]], [[disney history]]
            - similar to layers in photoshop/gimp

        - ([[diego de la hera]] worked with them)
        - [[symbiotic relationship]] with the fungus
    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
        - [[jerry]] +1 -- the big fungus is a metaphor for the result of this collaboration. But [[playnz]] might be an [[mvp]]/[[demo]] or just an experiment/playground for interoperability.
        - are these tools perhaps already playns?
            - they might be, yes.
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[progressive enhancement]] is key
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
            - how can we take all these tools and build an architecture that supports progressive enhancement?
            - we start with plain text as the base, then you can add things like markdown/html, then you add photos/media
        - [[flancian]] problems and opportunities:
            - exploring hub architecture vs full graph integration
            - lossiness as you interop through tools, playns
            - complexity of integrations
                - [[Chris Aldrich]] pairwise compatibility is a nightmare
