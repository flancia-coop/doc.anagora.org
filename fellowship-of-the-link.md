- Attending: [[jerry michalski]] [[peter kaminski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[bentley davis]] [[eduardo ivanec]] (flancian)
- [[peter kaminski]] channel suggestion 
- on [[ogm]] mailing lists and the purpose of [[open global mind]]
    - are we open, global? or more like left-leaning?
    - is it a discussion group or a place to get stuff done (tm)
    - #pk ogm as a group is getting lots done, just not strictly within that banner
    - #jm open question: how many OGMs are there?
    - #jm using social tools to make sense of our shared projects instead of individual tools
    - #pk [[kaffeeklatsch]]
- [[chris aldrich]] in his experience with communities, the best model seen is to throw email overboard -- and to use a public [[wiki]] that is easy to edit combined with a [[chat]] that is searchable.
    - #jm proposal:
      - [[mattermost]] for chat -- [[sense doing]]
      - [[massive wiki]] for wiki
    - [[flancian]] is there a [[shared calendar]]? for meetings such as OGM's and this one.
        - #jm Peter has a page in a massive wiki with
        - is there a source of truth for other resources as well?
    - [[flancian]] [[sense doing]] vs [[fellowship of the link]] channels
        - [[sense doing]] is a wider channel associated with a particular project
    - [[sense doing]] #jm name/focus?
        - #jm relationship with [[tools for thinking]] podcast
        - #jm [[covid response]] is a possible case study: what would the ideal national response look like?
        - #jm but [[tools for thinking]] history might be a better first study case, less politically charged
    - [[chris aldrich]] ~ #ca
        - should we disable the chat in jitsi and instead use something with archival?
    - [[flancian]] n.b. [[wikilinks everywhere]] and agora bot
        - [[python]]
    - [[chris aldrich]] has an acquaintance that is working on "how do you get a lab working with internal communication tools to publish a subset of their information" -- a grant application could be written 
        - [Joshua M. Greenberg](https://sloan.org/about/staff/joshua-m-greenberg)
        - #jm did some work in this space with [[marc antoine parent]] and [[bentley davis]]

        - Jack Dorsey apparently is granting funds, too 
        - [[librarian carpentries]] has two associated sites
        - #pk we have a number of projects that seem to be in this space
            - [[tile]], [[mosaic]] definitions could be used in this context, but we should stall on defining those

        - the deadpan Welsh translator: https://youtu.be/2g3m9p35cDo?t=40
    - email threads are impossible 
        - says:email threads exception that proves the rule: Linux kernel mailing list 
    - and email is difficult to archive well 
    - caveat 1: someone needs to maintain it all... 
    - The IndieWeb has an interactive bot that does help to capture from chat into the wiki, but that requires some programming lift to get done. 
    - France vs. Morocco, FIFA World Cup 2022™
        - for soccer, it's always the first five minutes and last five minutes. 
        - Vikings got to Morocco in AD 859:

### Thinking Tools Map Project

- website now published, <https://tftmap.massive.wiki/>
  - \o/
  - exciting progress on massive wiki -- Peter presents
      - hacked massive wiki theme to have a notice bar :)
      - had to get involved with some [[css frameworks]]
      - turns out that many sites seem fine with the menu scrolling with the content, having no fixed navbar, etc.
      - bentley: can offer CSS help, has experience
  - (airtable review)
  - #push [[massive wiki wednesday]]
      - https://hackmd.io/95GfL68PRsSc7wieGMgdAQ (temp location only)
      - moving from github to maybe [[codeberg]]
  - hoping to have Phase 0 done next week some time
  - [[permanent versions]]
      - a wiki is supposed to be changing all the time -- so giving a link to a page has always felt slightly weird to Peter, as the target will have changed by the time the recipient clicks on it
      - how to version?
          - point in time / commit, offer a link to HEAD?
          - approach:
              - sha256 / hashing based approach / content based addressing
              - of an html snapshot
                  - flancian: this might introduce dependencies on particular rendering engines
          - comparison vs ipfs actual content based addressing
              - (...)
      - on [[codeberg]] forking [[gitea]]
      - thoughts on [[chat gpt]]
          - 'automatic explanations' for change management/changes in a wiki
      - three word (or whatever) navigation to a particular git hash (sort of like the interface presented by [what3words](https://what3words.com/))
      - making git history more easily navigable by non-technical / non-Git experts
      - date-anchored vs content-anchored
          - interwiki links
  - #push [[gordon brander]] and [[subconscious]]
      - [[jerry michalski]] talked with him on Monday
      - [[noosphere]] would love to have at least a subset of Jerry's brain \o/
  - #push [[paul rony]] -- the founder of [[kosmik]] (sp?)
      - [[french]]
      - loves computer history
      - a podcast / community / etc. to talk about:
          - early visionaries (e.g. [[vannevar bush]])
          - how does that bridge into new tools and visions
- [[flancian]]
    - https://fotl.agor.ai
    - [[agora bridge]] approach / trying to reuse at least importing steps
    - [[jerry michalski]] -- take [[visions]] https://bra.in/2pxbo6 as a starting point, do nth degree crawling
    - [[peter kaminski]] 
        - [[meme brane]]
            - https://memebrane.conversence.com
        - [[jerry's brain]] in a postgresql database, where each node is a row
            - note that Jerry doesn't use node titles 
        - the above already don't map 1:1/well to [[massive wiki]] data structures
        - we're all representing information but that information has different shapes
        - lossy translations can be very lossy
     - [[flancian]]
         - (something optimist)
     - [[jerry michalski]]
         - most of his brain would usually end up looking like small markdown files with a link
         - [[peter kaminski]] relatively easy to move data brain -> massive wiki, but it's not obvious how to go the other way
     - https://mcbrain.netlify.app/brainish/jerry/32f9fc36-6963-9ee0-9b44-a89112919e29

            - [[mathew lowry]] there was also a lack of alignment in perspectives.
            - [[chris aldrich]] terms were severe enough that it sounded like authors needed to pay them (for further editions?)

                - #ca the indieweb approach of 'local first, then syndicate' is resilient to this
            - archival program

- Attending: [[peter kaminski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[aram zucker-scharff]] [[jerry michalski]] [[flancian]]
- [[peter kaminski]] [[airtable]]
    - #push [[thinking tools map]]
        - working on [[project plan]] prior to bringing it to the [[fellowship of the link]]
        - https://dainty-sable-264aa3.netlify.app/project/measuring_thinking_tools.html
    - [[chris aldrich]] [[openness]] axis seems too dense
        - we should also assume that developers will tackle the low hanging fruit / perform minimum effort to tick a box if that's within reach :)
        - [[mathew lowry]] is keen on keeping the number of dimensions low-ish, 6-8 dimensions
            - which would look nice in a spidergraph
        - [[chris aldrich]] also makes sense to apply the pareto principle
    - [[calendar]] https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NW8zbXUzOXAxMWZxNjlydGFwcWV0YnNnZWQgcGV0ZXIua2FtaW5za2lAbQ&tmsrc=peter.kaminski%40gmail.com
        - [[flancian]] link doesn't seem to work?
- [[aram zucker-scharff]] interoperability
    - easiest way is to piggyback on what they're already doing
    - people onboarding onto [[mastodon]]
        - people coming up with lots of new things in the tool space -- many requiring to sign in with both mastodon and twitter
        - [[chris aldrich]] no algorithmic feed, fewer features -- as a feature :)
        - instances are more like twitter lists, at a similar level
        - [[mastodon]] vs the rest of the [[fediverse]], e.g. [[lemmy]] / [[pleroma]]
    - [[bluesky]]
        - associated with [[twitter]], but
        - [[pfrazee]]
    - #jm is there something better than ActivityPub/Mastodon for people that want a replacement?
        - [[flancian]] don't know anything promising currently that is not ActivityPub based
        - [[pleroma]] [[lemmy]] [[misskey]] are all built on top of ActivityPub too
     - [[advertising]] as an option to individuals funding instances as hobby projects
     - [[coops]] as another option
         - #azs [[data coops]]
     - #jm book about quakers / morals and [[travelling brothers]]
         - history of [[guilds]]
         - industrial revolution starts to hit, early capitalists realize they need to undermine the guild system

         - [[apprentice]] -> [[yeomen]] -> [[master]]
         - [[masterpiece]] is what the [[yeomen]] had to build to become a master
         - "advertising is the colonizing force of capitalism in internet spaces"
         - [[mutual aid]] societies yielded technologies like [[insurance]]
         - it feels like we're trying to find our way back to some of these concepts
     - #azs book on modern unions
         - you can't get to the revolution until people feel safe

 ## 2022-10-26
- Attending: [[peter kaminski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[flancian]] [[bentley davis]] [[maparent]] [[samuel klein]]
- Second call on [[Wednesday]].
- Recording in Jitsi only works in Chromium.
    - No firefox, no safari for now.
    - Worth filing a bug.
- Last time recap
    - Integration of tools for thought
    - Hyperknowledge and Agora
    - Debate tools and quality of discourse as they relate to the political scene
- Check ins
    - [[maparent]]
        - Discussed a lot of common issues in [[free jerry's brain]] meeting on Monday.
        - In there we spoke about [[hyperknowledge]] and [[next actions]] as well.
        - Among other things, made a plea for [[concept glue]] between systems.
            - Deep links, deep addressability aspects seem key.
            - Making cross linking easy.
        - Bentley brought up: we could achieve a better understanding by trying some use cases and seeing which kind of maps do we want to build off real data.
            - [[flancian]] we had a pending AI from a previous meeting that 
        - [[frame views]] URLs for concepts and for frames centered around that thing
            - [[flancian]] sounds similar to [[nodes]]
            - [[chris aldrich]] lots of note taking tools are text based, and backing databases are non public / don't have URLs
                - #map deep linking and addressability is indeed about having a URL for each block even in those scenarios
                - [[web annotations]] use ranges, we could have the same for markdown
                - "xpath for markdown"
                    - +1
                    - web annotation targets for markdown
                - [[flancian]] what about wikilinks as anchors within notes?
                    - #map semantic ambiguity
                        - #flancian Not sure
                    - #map doesn't work in the general case as it's only controlled by the writer
                        - #flancian: fair
                        - #maparent look at at-json
                - 'this thing in this document at this time' -- [[memento protocol]] for example
                    - "memento protocol over massive wiki"
                    - could map to a git commit in the case of git backed repositories
                    - [[chris aldrich]] could be resolved via internet archive for the web in the general case when that is available
                    - [[maparent]] Actually used by web archive. See http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/about/
                - [[meta]] how do we track of 'interesting threads' like that above?
                    - [[peter kaminski]] what about a shared page?
                    - -> AI: create a document/repository location and designate it as first version of this :)
    - [[Peter Kaminski]]
            - [[Thinking Tools Map Project]] update
                - [[mathew lowry]] did a fair amount of work
                - some of our project work got out of sync but it's being merged
                - realization: we had not set up a way to do collaboration beforehand, both platform and convention level
                - -> [[massive wiki channel]] in [[ogm mattermost]]
                    - <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki>
                    - <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/nshenqwxxj8mbq1rptiddut96r>
                - collaborating over chat is relatively hard, threading is only basic
                - [[github issues]] and branches
                    - maybe a document workflow with comments would be lighterweight?
                    - Note: issues in git (vs github) with [GitBug](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug)
            - Looked again at Markdown parsers (particularly those that can create ASTs, because that's a sign of development organization and quality)
                - [remark](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/project/remarkjs/remark/) + [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) (JavaScript)
                - [mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe) (Python)
                    - [[flancian]] the Agora (Python) currently uses [[marko]], but mistletoe looks superior at first glance
                    - [[markdoc]] is an extended [[markdown]] syntax created/used by [[stripe]]
            - [[schema]]
                - [[people]] [[tools]] [[techniques]]
                - #map [[goals]] maybe as a separate category, or [[intent]]
                - maybe also [[audience]]
                - -> AI: add to threaded document.
            - Wishing there were typed links in Markdown
                - [[flancian]] in the Agora, links are typed/annotated by the preceding one (or tag)
                - @scalingsynthesis uses prefixes: https://anagora.org/@scalingsynthesis
                - [[chris aldrich]] [[microformats]] could be part of a link
                - #map [[yaml]] blocks could go anywhere?
                    - [[supertag]] syntax is growing on him
                    - see Gyuri's work on Trailmarks
        - [[sj]] - I think a good 80% solution for reconciling different types into a single namespace is to support [[TOPIC (qualifier)]], have it rendered while reading as just TOPIC, and have the link to [[TOPIC (qualifier)]] redirect to any of: "TOPIC", TOPIC (qualifier)", "TOPIC#qualifier" etc. which authority file can be updated by any editor of the markdown network (and may change as people take time to fill out nodes for increasingly specific variations on the topic).  
            - very similar to what i came to
    - [[flancian]] have been meaning to collect a list of repositories which we would like integrate into a shared construct (agora wink wink) -- do you have any?
        - [[peter kaminski]] massive wiki is agnostic w.r.t. versioning and sharing models (or tries to be)
            - for git, [[massive wiki]] can have submodules
            - [[massive wiki builder]] will build
        - do you have note repositories of your own, personal or otherwise?
            - [[peter kaminski]] have one but not currently shareable :)
            - AI: suggest we keep discussing this in future instances
                - [[sister sites]], sister pages
                - twin pages
                - interwiki
                - web rings :)
                - wiki [[collaboration primitives]]
                - Instant wikilinks / cascading wikisheets: implicit interwiki resolution (a la https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/InstantCommons) :: make the local .cws legible so you can see the order in which your current interface looks for matching nodes in choosing the default interwiki 
                    - try variation that chooses cascade order based on length/quality of target node
                    - try interface variation that shows top N options in asymmetric list/pie
                - [[fedwiki]] is brilliant but the feeling of the room is that we don't fully understand it
                    - is there people building any kind of business providing fedwiki widely/easily?
                    - https://byname.wiki.conversence.com
                - sj: update vocab to distinguish meki from wiki 
      - #map [[coauthor]] https://coauthor.conversence.com
    - Q: [[sj]] how to capture third-party cross-wiki page-name-maps?   e.g. say we read together a dozen sources, which are not generally world editable, and are building (in a shared space) interwiki links + merge requests across the set of pages in those sources.
        - [[maparent]] this is what I meant by "glue" earlier, it's a core [[HyperKnowledge]] goal
- AIs
    - AI: start a [[tracking document]] for tracking pending interesting threads
        - done -> [[fotl threads]]
    - AI: Then let's do a pass collecting all useful links we already have in this node and in [[fotl]] and move them to [[fotl threads]].
    - AI: Let's move communications over chat for the above projects to the [[fellowship of the link]] channel by default, or share links there to other sources of truth.
    - AI: let's discuss wiki [[collaboration primitives]] and the potential of integrating independent note taking repositories/wikis a la massive wiki / agora
    - AI: add schema section to [[fotl threads]]
    - AI: upload recording to some well known location :)
        - [[bentley]] suggest putting the raw file in drive first

        - we want:
            - [[deep hyperlinks]]
            - deep [[anchoring]] (new, a la [[web annotations]])
            - many to many relationships between anchors and entities
        - [[flancian]] we probably want this second level map for projects that are trying to work on interlinking

        - [[maparent]] focusing on the differences:
            - [[deep backlinks]]
        - any single idea will be in millions of contexts, how to keep the graph "readable" 
        - attribution/degree of belief
            - surface surprising beliefs, beliefs that could be questioned
        - [[jerry michalski]] deck of patterns for cognitive biases
            - swipe right / swipe left? :)
        - [[jerry michalski]] real world example
            - half of the republicans running now *say* that the election was stolen
            - should this ideally disqualify them? 
            - #map ~ [[maparent]] we want to qualify belief by track record, e.g. the work of [[superforecasters]]
            - distinguish empty claims from testable claims
        - what's the minimum set of coordinated actions we could take to maximize the chances this great crowdsourcing effort happens?
            - hashtags/wikilinks as one way to coordinate -- but might not be enough?
            - [[chris aldrich]] the [[instagram problem]]
            - [[flancian]] the Agora tries to make it so that the community can cross-link oportunistically/share entities and auto link
            - [[maparent]] worried about ambiguity still regardless of whether they are autogenerated or human generated
        - [[chris aldrich]] on the recent controversy in US politics with racially charged comments by politicians
            - #map [[dao]] and [[smart contracts]] -- enforced accountability

        - #map working on a plan and a prototype for [[hyperknowledge]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] how to push actors towards more precise speech (to counteract Trump's style of not saying anything but convincing some people he is aligned with them, even in the centre left initially)
        - two kinds of self organization:
            - self organization around a shared goal in a self-selected group
            - coordinated action in a very large scale

                        - (Looks like the publisher is https://exapt.press)
                        - Chris is likely dropping out
                    - #jm if you were to create a version of this book that was more interesting, what would it look like?

### Videos

### Notes
- Introductions!
- [[jerry michalski]] ~ #jm
    - on previous calls
    - on sometimes having overlap in different dimensions but not having shared clarity/understanding
    - sharing clarity vs rambling
    - happens even at the organizational level when you're trying to set up a mission statement
        - [[motherhood statements]] ~ "we believe in X", "we believe in Y" -- but we're usually looking for nuggets of novelty
    - [[numenta]]
        - would like to jump into a "digested format"
        - [[prediction framework]]
            - as [[society of mind]]
- #push [[Gene]] and [[Jerry Michalski]] go way back
    - [[system thinker]] -> [[storyteller]]
    - #go https://bra.in/8vGe9q
    - married and divorced [[the brain]] multiple times
    - uses [[napkin]]
    - [[richard maxis]] ~ [[richard macksey]], former Johns Hopkins University professor with a large personal library
    - #push [[richard macksey]]
        - [[library background]]
        - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/34f84a89-4bc2-46f5-ac9b-b3ba8e8bff11/notes
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvXUHI331k
        - [[umberto eco]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czc_KjWji8E
        - [[library tours]]
- Spider chart example
    - reusable ethical services might be a competitive advantage of tools in the [[commons]]
    - commercial tools seem to have an advantage in the current market -- they get the backing of the market "leads" (VC, etc.) which lets them out-compete freer options
        - uber is not a [[fair marketplace]], yet it outcompeted more ethical alternatives
        - on the [[hypocrisy]] of "fake markets" -- platforms that behave like markets but are controlled by a single entity
            - #push [[fake markets]]
                - https://bra.in/8vBe4W
    - [[chris aldrich]] ~ #ca if we did [[spider graphs]], how do you select axis to focus on?
        - how do we present this information in a way that prioritizes the ethical aspect, and perhaps helps tool developers prioritize lacking dimensions?
        - #jm selecting dimensions in different contexts
        - #jm finding which tools are missing, which tools are complementary
            - "which tools play well with each other"
        - #ca another thing which is important to people in this space: even though [[obsidian]] is not open source, people find it easy to develop against it and it's got open source extensions
            - so it seems unlikely they will turn into a new Twitter
            - but even in that case it seems you could move to other players which are more open
    - [[bentley]] implemented [[filtering]] in [[spider graphs]] (demo)
    - #jm what is [[indieweb]]'s perspective on convincing people to build openly?
        - #ca #push [[indieweb]] they have built a structure on a two prong idea:
            - you own your own domain name
                - [[flancian]] ~ #f what about weakening this into "you own some URL space"
                - #ca it's possible, but at the end of the day you want to own what a URL resolves to
                - the ecosystem is developing in the direction of letting you redirect between domains
            - you have control over your data
            - #jm what about separating data from apps, e.g. storing on github?
                - as in, you map any new tool to the same existent dataset
                - #ca you can point tools in [[indieweb]] to repositories of data
                - #ca #push [[micropub]] is a spec; a "data plug board" that allows people to easily write apps that publish events to different consumers
                    - #go https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
                    - a post goes first to your website
                    - then the website has the know how on how to publish to feeds
                    - [[bookmark service]] is the [[hello world]] here
                - [[medium]] could rewrite its backend to support [[micropub]] and it would let you cross post to many other sites
                - #f how does this interact with [[activitypub]]?
                    - #ca it fits in this model but it's a steeper learning curve
                    - in most of the AP space, if you don't interop with [[mastodon]], you don't exist
                    - lots of tools target [[mastodon]] as it supports some core things well
                - [[aram zucker]]

                    - the field of [[x clone]] in the [[fediverse]]
                    - no single AP client that supports all features
                    - [[lemmy]] as an interesting example of new platform built on [[activitypub]]
                    - [[goodreads]] functionality

            - #f [[go/t4t radar]] points to the chart (- and + also work for spaces)
                - which categories do we want here?
                - linking articles to support scores/opinions
                - #f [[assertion feeds]]
                - #jm spreadsheet is easily embeddable to begin with
                - #ml publishing markdown/resources to repositories and sharing that
            - #f [[gardens]] and [[feeds]]? :)
            - #ml can we add domains/repositories to what is searching?
                - #f yes
            - [[aram zucker-scharff]] ~ [[az]]
            - #jm [[noosphere]]
            - #ca most of the big commercial offerings allow people to store data on [[dropbox]] or [[google drive]]
                - [[agora]] could enable people to move from [[dropbox]] to [[git]] based workflows
                - micropub spec ostensibly could be used for moving from platform [[x]] to platform [[y]]

    - done!

### Notes
- [[jerry michalski]]
    - [[render]] ~ [[tools for thinking]]
- [[flancian]]
    - great introduction
    - great conversation with [[howard rheingold]]
    - amazing announcement by [[gordon brander]]: [[noosphere]]
        - it is [[an agora]], done very well!
- [[jerry michalski]] welcomes [[dan whaley]]!
  - [[dan whaley]]
      - Fridays are much better meeting wise!
      - very busy but 
      - [[14 million dollars]] investment from [[ithaka]] and [[jstor]] https://web.hypothes.is/blog/say-hello-to-anno/
  - how does this interact with the global [[knowledge commons]]?
      - [[annotations]] -> the knowledge is in the annotation you take
      - but the annotation is layered on preexisting on knowledge
      - it's about protocols and things but also about seeding [[communities]]
  - [[hypothesis]] cares about the user having access to the underlying knowledge
      - regardless of whether it's because it's free or they happen to have (exclusive?) access
      - this knowledge could be resolved in a federated network
          - clients using open protocols like [[web annotations]] can participate in this network
      - [[flancian]] how does this relate to [[markets]]?
          - and the fairness of said markets.
          - IMHO [[commons]] should [[embed]] markets
          - [[dan whaley]] the knowledge is what's "out there" right now, we try to pass no judgment and support the existing models
              - most universities have access to [[json]], but most others don't
              - the [[nyt]] is not free
                  - > paywalls
              - some content might always be gated
              - the world may be moving towards [[free access]] but that will happen on its own terms?
              - [[hypothesis]] thinks there's a sustainable path for them; charging for institutional usage maybe but making the conversation available to everybody
                  - not doing ads
                      - -> [[reality distortion matrix]]
                      - silos trying to [[monetize attention]]
                  - constructive ways of funding
                  - open [[saas]]
       - [[mathew lowry]] have you watched [[render]] / [[tools for thinking]]
           - [[dan whaley]] not yet!
           - [[mathew lowry]] interesting ai potential exploration
           - what are your thoughts on integrating AI with hypothesis?
               - "here is what your friends think about X in the web" vs "here is what an AI thinks about X in the web"
               - [[dan whaley]]
                   - AI is super interesting as created by humans for humans
                   - a force for good to help us navigate the world more powerfully
                   - but of course there are negative use cases, so we need to set the right incentives
               - [[flancian]]
                   - may not there be a difference in the long term? :)
               - in terms of influencing AI
                   - (... saw something in chat :))
               - mathew: valuable content layered on top of layered content.
                   - -> sentiment analysis and meta sentiment analysis
                   - people benefiting from the AI they train instead of the current status quo
               - [[dan whaley]] very privileged to have access to this data, and to steer a new paradigm
                   - find revenues that can sustain this while being pro social is critical
                   - only will explore what will be beneficial
               - [[jerry michalski]]
                   - [[douglas tomkins]] (sp?) and [[x]] from [[patagonia]]
                   - building land tracts and are trying to turn it into a trust
                       - (!)
                   - is there one ambitious funding project that could be explored for maximum benefit here?
                   - could we fund the [[idea commons]] on some large, ambitious scale?
                       - [[flancian]] using the commons, regulating markets, to disrupt the market for public good
                   - [[dan whaley]] what is the change we want to make?
                       - you could imagine all kinds of things
                           - one idea: how could you incentivize people to make annotations professionally?
                           - meaning high quality "trailblazers"
                           - proposed legislation
                           - pre annotating bills!
                           - what would it take to be able to fund this
                       - concept of [[reddit gold]]
                           - chip in to providing high quality contributions?
                       - fixing the [[newspaper subcription model]]
                           - you put 10 bucks in, it goes to the authors of the things you read
                           - [[jerry michalski]] reinventing [[xanadu]] in a way
                       - [[jerry michalski]]

                           - [[dan whaley]] it's a flow
                           - like mycellian nutrients
                           - [[flancian]] meta on the metaphor
                           - [[chris aldrich]] [[redwood trees]] network roots to be able to stand up taller
                               - for most trees, they tend to be mirror images
                               - not so redwoods
                       - [[data trust]]
                         - [[chris aldrich]] how to get good quality data in general  
                             - [[twitter]] is already a great repository of annotations in a sense, but you have to sift through a lot more stuff to go to the gems
                             - [[jerry michalski]] [[nugget ratio]] is very high if you curate your follows
                             - [[flancian]] -> the [[social network]] is what encodes the most information
                                 - the importance of [[open ranking]], [[open filtering]], [[open algorithms]] -> [[open ais]]
                             - [[jerry michalski]] why are [[tools for conversation]] not [[tools for thinking]]?
                                 - the lack of good permalinks in interesting answers in random forums
                                     - walled gardens
                                 - one of the nice things about hypothes.is is that it's got a great signal to noise ratio and you can easily link to full contexts
                             - [[indieweb]] is important here
                             - [[mathew lowry]] [[myhub]] is part of [[indieweb]]
                                 - on the following relationship
                                 - as leading to flows -> (of attention, of funding)
                             - [[flancian]] hypothes.is integrations with [[feeds]]? it already provides feeds, how important they seem to you
                                 - [[dan whaley]] we provide feeds but are not currently looking at providing more
                                 - focusing on providing arbitrary annotation for arbitrary web resources
                             - [[chris aldrich]] how do you also not aggregate streams only, but how do you turn those feeds into something feedin a [[garden]]

### Notes
Jerry's brain for this session: https://bra.in/6p63ZP

- [[betaworks]] conference: https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking
- [[Mathew Lowry]]
    - WordPress plugin to syndicate news orgs from multiple sites of different languages 
    - Would be useful to give publishers more to cite and a better understanding  
    - A type of shared memory 
    - Hard to get journalists to adopt the tool
    - A bunch of different organizations sharing the tools for mutral benifit. 
    - From Mattermost - https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/gbonf7z177yquffqz59mu8uino :
        - The basic idea was to create CMS plug-ins for newsrooms which would allow journalists in different participating newsrooms to access each other's content, both published and otherwise (ie, drafts, notes, etc.), via their CMS. The  participating newsrooms essentially become a sort of decentralised press agency. This is particularly interesting in Europe, where every newsroom cannot have a journalist in every country. Hence the system would incorporate machine translation, autocategorisation and autosummary. Obviously, every time newsroom A used newsroom B's content - ie A translated and republished B's article into their own language for their own audience - newsroom B would earn credit. And every time B used A's, they would spend that credit.
        - This is a very specific use case, with a business model, for decentralised sharing. And the social benefit is real, because it would set up a decentralised alternative to the big press agencies and allow stories which they will never pick up to travel across borders and find new audiences.

- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - https://restofworld.org/ 
    - Old version of [[Zemanta]]
        - A blog post "enhanced" by Zemanta https://hacktext.com/2011/02/what-is-a-text-and-how-do-i-hack-it-521/

- Potential space for this [[WordCamp for Publishers]] https://twitter.com/wcpublishers/
    - Great event, highly recommend! - Aram
- There's the https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/ that is really great. 
- Chris
    - The NYT has a digital archive team of about 3
    - Photos are not fully backed up there
    - 2 decades of working on the problem and not everything is backed up. 
- Mathew
    - The European Commission relies on the Internet Archive for websites they no longer wish to maintain. 
- Jerry
    - YouTube has its own storage problems stuff is not well archived. It is remarkable that they even capture what they can. 
    - The future digital anthropoligsts what will they find?
- Aram
    - Archiving should be something anyone can do and have on their own site 
    - Just like [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) there should also be link once and archive yourself 
    - These systems should be able to talk to each other and share and replicate their resources
- Jerry
    - How does this survive though? My hard drives don't survive me 
- Chris
    - We have this problem with music - we saw how a lot of that music got lost.
    - Tip of the iceburg - so much history is lost 
    - music notation didn't exist in printed forms until about 11th century
- Jerry
    - In Small Things Forgotten 
    - Gravestones are very useful for history. Also potery. 
    - Tiny differences in gravestones over time are fashion trends that are time indicators. 
- Aram
    - I think in terms of preservation we can look at Activity Pub. When you federate with another server it pulls and replicates and distrubutes stuff. It would be great if we could get that done with archives. 
    - Open sourcing is good as well
- Mathew 
    - If you link to something you automatically make a backup is a good idea
    - What does this have to do with content sharing? 
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage
        - http://open-content.net/caw
        - One peice of content can be shared out replicated and shares an address across many locations.
- Smallest Federated Wiki 
- IPFS but pinning is an issue. 
- Collective intellegence - what that means for spread and maintenance 
- Songlines Are the Original Blockchain - https://bra.in/5jQYgm
- Jerry
    - A lot of ways of remembering were intentionally destroyed by colonization 
    - [[Songlines]] are an example of that
    - but it turns out that these ways of handling it are important.
    - Local populations carefully crafting things and being overwritten by colonization. 
- The Biggest Estate on Earth: How the Aborigines Made Australia (2011) 
- Chris
    - [[David Christian]] on [[collective intelligence]]: The beginning of collective knowledge and intellegence as the marker for the beginning of human history. 
-  Jerry
    - Christian talked about how there are not hooks in the work to be able to pull his data out of his finished thesis. 
    - Humans are really good at killing themselves off and then passed down the ways they learned not to. 
- How practices spread and disceminate? 
- We overvalue the written world - Jerry. 
- Mathew
    - An overvalue of memorization 
    - Greeks overvalued it and that was the end point of oral learning. 
- What does a non-literary method look like here? 
- Aram:
    - [Queens Memory](https://queensmemory.org/) - Podcasts as a method of oral history 
    - Memes and emoji as inconographic languages 
- Jerry
    - There are others as well like NPR's project here that do podcasts for oral histories 
    - [[The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image]] (1998) 
- Aram
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis
- Chris
    - Interesting project to 'write' coreography in a way that isn't the standard way of transmitting coreography
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_notation
    - Different ways to lay out colors an images to annotate video - how could you have a recorded record that could be used to recreate a movie from the notes. 
- Graphic facilitators 
- Mathew
    - volcano model for desktop information - starts in the center and slowly flows towards the sides until it falls off the desktop. 
- Aram
    - Reminds me of 3d desktops
        - ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_43742f2c6167180e0f75a72217f54e4e.png)
- Jerry
    - [[Songlines]] on the desktop 
    - Grapiphic facilitation at conferences 
    - Point back at stuff that was written on the wall from a previous day. 
    - What would The Brain look like as the file system for an operating system. 
    - synecure
- Aram
    - Archiving as a regular personal practice 
- Chris
    - References of people who value their knowledge so they protect against it being lost to history. 
        - These bound books over here with all my notes take them out of the house 
- Jerry
    - Tools for thinking - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/4bfe6526-9884-4b6d-9548-23659da7811e/ 
- https://scalingsynthesis.com/
- Scaling Synthesis - Multiplayer TFT https://lu.ma/9a21amd7 from 2022-08-09 video should be available shortly from [[Boris Mann]] et al.
- Should we write a database of these things or should we poll people and publish interviews? What tools do people recommend?
    - Good example: https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book 
    - Would be good to hear from people: 
        - I have this practice 
        - this  is how I use it 
        - this is what it looks like 
        - and this is how I turn it into outputs? 
    - Looking at how people use their information graphs and how they visualize information 
    - It would be really valuable to me to know if I want a good graph this is what it looks like 
    - Why isn't there more documentation of these tools and how could it lead to interoperability 
- Chris
    - Even the history of the tree space isn't as well known or broadly distributed.... 
    - Lima, Manuel. [[The Book of Trees]]: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, 2014. 
        - https://papress.com/products/the-book-of-trees-visualizing-branches-of-knowledge

- Jerry
    - Could we have a [[pattern language]] for this? 
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language
    - Ex: Light from Two Walls can become a shorthand for talking about loose rules that trigger understand and contextualization. 
    - Ex: [[1 2 4 all]]
        - [Jerry write up of instrumenting](https://wiki.rel8.dev/tile_-_1-2-4-all_zoom_app)
- Mathew
    - Is there a syntax or thesouras for pattern languages
- Jerry
    - Patern Languages of Pattern Languages
        - https://www.hillside.net/plop/2022/ 
    - Chatbots maybe a solution?
        - Hey I'm intersted in Starting with Tools for Thinking
- Aram
    - Maybe just a question and answer page?
- Jerry
    - And then you could feed it into a Chat Bot
- Mathew
    - How do we help people find the right tool for them
    - How do we help people find the right pattern langugage for them. 
- Aram
    - It seem swe have to interview people first and get them to talk us through it. 
    - Do we need a questionaire? 
- Jerry
    - a smorgasbord of thinking tool users' preferences
    - There is some skill required to pull people out of their over-complexity.
- [ ] questionnaire for thinking tool users? 
    - What are you using this tool for and why? 
    - What did you wish your tool suite did? 
    - In the note taking space a lot of people don't think out the longg term value 
    - Creating one or two notes a day over a year before the big affordances become obvious 
    - what is the long term value of your tool suite and process? 
    - create a 3 minute video of your most typical use case 
        - UX Studies Practice here ?
            - Narrate yourself through the proceess and what you are thinking 
- Chris
    - Very few people get to the 3 or 4 month mark where they see pay off from notetaking.
    - Not many people are writing about it as a benefit either. 
- Mathew
    - We need to use the 5 why technique - we need to ask why a lot
    - Not everyone wants to use notes for creation, some are just collectors. 
- Chris
    - Some people have collect a lot of stuff as the only goal and then the assumption is that [[note taking magic]] happens, but that isn't really the case. 
- People find a system and then want to sell it and that can be a problem
    - [[GTD]] aka [[getting things done]] is an example here
    - [[nick milo]] and [[linking your thinking]] https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/
- [[Memory]] and [[major system]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system as a historical example of people selling intellectual systems or frameworks. This is playing itself out again with note taking tools.

### Notes
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[betaworks]] render event next week about [[tools for thought]] [[2022-08-16]]
        - [[nyc]]
        - https://render.betaworks.com/thinkcamp-a-betaworks-accelerator-program-for-tools-for-thinking-de7e18bf5682
    - how to get a [[posse]] working together
    - [[chorus of voices]]
- [[internet slowness]]
    - [[van jacobson]]
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson_TCP/IP_Header_Compression
- on [[conventions]]
    - [[lower caps]] vs [[initial caps]]
        - eventual fixup
        - eventual convergence :)
    - inclusivity aspect of it: be liberal w.r.t. what you take
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] myhub does the same, lowercase by default everywhere. Based on my (poor) experience with Roam.
    - arguments for/against
        - [[lower caps]]
        - [[initial caps]]
            - more readable
            - the cost of writing caps is helped by tools like [[obsidian]] auto completing links once you type \[\[
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] about unicode coalescing (there's a better word for this) in both directions, pros and cons
            - (...)
            - very used to writing in caps anyway
            - ex: platforms like instagram show how people "exploit" hashtags by using many similar ones to have greater reach
            - a platform could actually coalesce hashtags
                - [[triangle thinking]] ~ [[combinatorial creativity]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] operationalizing communal note taking in preparation for [[betaworks]]
    - how do you do note taking?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] almost on git but not currently
            - most of the public stuff starts in [[hypothes.is]]
            - notes in hypothes.is have permalinks
                - actually have two URLs:
                    - one for the page/resource you annotated followed by a trigger for hypothes.is to open and show the annotation in context
                    - one in the hypothes.is domain which refers to the actual annotation proper
                    - "[[js;dr]] problem"
                - [[Jerry Michalski]]
                    - you can share a highlight to a passage using the current #... convention
                - https://indieweb.org/media_fragment (thanks!)
                - https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/
                - hypothes.is reads the tags and uses it for presenting annotations/highlights
                - https://www.w3.org/annotation/
                - https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/

- [[jerry michalski]] on 
    - #push [[how people think]]
        - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/think/
    - how could we bridge these numbered 1 .. 17 aspects with:
        - notes about the same in other note taking systems
        - hypothes.is annotations on those sections
    - [[mathew lowry]] which level of granularity do you use for your notes? resource/concept/etc. 
        - how to map one to the other?
        - [[jerry michalski]] call this the [[nugget problem]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] [[nugget size]] vs [[zoom levels]]
        - [[jerry michalski]] 
            - [[ted nelson]]
                - [[stretch text]] ~ [[StretchText]] (1967)
                - [[hypertext fiction]]
                - AI(flancian): tell [[armengol]] about this, he was working on something related.
            - Q: is there typing in [[thebrain]] or some other way to distinguish nuggets from e.g. full resources?
                - it could encode this but the way Jerry uses it loses this information
                - Jerry does not use some features just because they slow him down / they take a lot of time
                - [[Mark Trexler]] uses more of these features and is a [[climate change]] expert.
            - [[chris aldrich]] the labels/wikilinks that you used for these are unlikely to be the same other people use.
                - (but once these are known to all be in a particular resource...)
                - [[google search]] including fragment lookup in search results in some sites
                    - engineering focused solution
                - (on striping tracking data from URLs)
                - [[building blocks]]
                    - if it's online, there'a permalink to it somewhere; that's a starting point
                    - [[media fragments]] to dig into text, video, audio
            - [[rel8 pioneers]]
                - where to [[meet]] in this notion of [[idea sex]]?
                    - [[schelling point]]
                        - where would we go in the internet if we couldn't pass information about the place?
                - which places, which formats?
                - [[chris aldrich]] [[permalinks]] and [[wikilinks everywhere]]
                    - negotiating equivalence between wikilinks in different repositories
                    - -> [[agora]]
                    - [[peter hagen]]

                    - [[optimistic linking]]
                        - wishful thinking with dangling links
                    - [[mathew lowry]]
                        - fedwiki for working on convergent links/pages
                        - [[chris aldrich]] creating [[red links]] (in wiki terms), it would be nice to be able to get resolution paths whenever one is clicked (resolve this in X, Y or Z)
                        - [[jerry michalski]] the autocomplete in obsidian could be extended to resolve in expanding circles
                            - #push [[patterns]]
                                - #127 [[intimacy gradient]]

                    - AI(flancian): add it to the Agora as one of the search "providers" :)
                    - [[mellow twitter]] https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Aretweets%20-filter%3Areplies%20-filter%3Alinks&src=typd
- next actions for [[betaworks]] conference
    - -> [[fotl mattermost chat]]
    - [[mathew lowry]] which visual language do you envision here?
    - [[jerry michalski]]
        - in this private language:
            - [[caret]] ~ [[>]] means incorporate into brain
            - cloud means private
        - but there's many views that make sense for different context, different people
        - the all singing, all dancing platform lets you choose your own view based on what you need and shift between them
        - how to solve this?
            - [[flancian]] assume it will work and then make it work :)
                - gather resources of many different types/mental models, all about the same entity/event/thing
                - then try to make them coalesce and translate between each other
            - [[chris aldrich]] solving the general problem is hard, start with subproblems
                - (someone who solved a related problem)
            - [[jerry michalski]] [[unix model]]
                - composability
                - separate data from (apps?)
    - [[john borthwick]]
        - [[commons culture]] / [[startup culture]]
        - [[civilizational commons]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] it would help to offer a wiki and tools for thought introduction/historical context
            - -> [[rel8 tiles]] ~ https://wiki.rel8.dev/tiles
            - (built on [[massive wiki]] which is git based) -> https://github.com/OpenGlobalMind/rel8-wiki
    - "in a breakfast of ham and eggs, the chicken is [[involved]], the pig is [[committed]]."
        - building lightweight [[bridges]] between tools.

### Notes
Jerry's brainf for this meeting: https://bra.in/7j3ewE

- [[Anagora]] shared notes 
- #push [[Commonplace books]]
    - Passed down
    - Example: [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s was left to his family. [[Charles Darwin]] used it and passed it down; it's now in a library
    - Easier to do now on the web while active, harder to preserve 
        - https://indieweb.org/longevity
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - Context.center 
        - [Timelines at work](https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-timelines/) - I find timelines to be really useful on understanding and progressing things and finding pattersn and understanding causes.
    - Logging git work and developing in public to make reference easier. 
        - [[Paul Frazee]] - works on [[Beaker]] and other [[Hyper]] projects. 
            - Really cool logging of code work linked with live streaming -  https://paulfrazee.medium.com/building-in-the-open-70ac9dccf1aa 
        - fightwithtools.dev - stream of thought developer notes linked to git commits (still in progress). Trying to make my work more approachable. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]]: What about [[Spaced Repetition]]
    - [[mnemonic medium]]
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/6900f8c3-d117-94dc-4996-39241bd989e0/ 
    - Chris Aldrich: [Piotr Woźniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher))
    - [[mnemonic reading]]
    - [[Anki]] https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 
    - Duolingo
    - A useful version of this is active notetaking while reading articles - perhaps combined
        - Refrence to Genius and other web highlighting/note-taking layers that exist 
    - [[Soren Bjornstad]] formerly of Anki and now at Remnote has lots of work on spaced repetition https://www.sorenbjornstad.com/writing/ 
    - [[David Weinberger]] [[automated summarization]] could play a role here? 
    - [[Mathew Lowry]]: Something I want to add to MyHub
        - Imagine you are creating another piece of content in the same zone - remember you asked this question to yourself 5 months ago?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: Recently worked on a timeline learning tool - where you get a package of articles in a timeline and it tracks your reading of each article. I wonder if it works with the automated summization content to create learning cards?
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: It might be interesting to see about giving people different orders of articles than just date saved, that they store so they can build narratives out of those cards. 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: You can pull date from metadata btw. Also: Narrative creation by ordering cards is really interesting. One example of this is Will Wright's tool for Current TV - https://hacktext.com/2011/02/crowd-sourced-television-goes-to-the-next-level-with-bar-karma-and-storymaker-477/
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Founder of https://redforester.com/ is working on something similar that takes elements and can organize them in different ways. I recommended animation to different forks. 
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: Taking notes then reviewing them - asking yourself a question that forces you to produce an answer is a far better method of review that simply re-reading material. Example: [[Cornell Notes]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes 
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Five Rs of Note Taking: 
        - Recite
        - Record
        - Reduce
        - Reflect
        - Review 
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: Do you have a set of pre-generated questions that you can slot specific things into or is it more freeform? (To Chris)
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: [[Cloze]] process where, when you are writing it/taking up the notes you use brackets that mean you are already writing the card. 
        - Have to make sure the questions are not too open ended. 
        - Usually one or two sentences with only a few things missing. 
        - I use it very sparingly because I have other methods I prefer to [[Spaced Repetition]]
        - Actively linking notes also helps a great deal. 
    - book: Memory Craft: Improve Your Memory with the Most Powerful Methods in History (2019) by [[Lynne Kelly]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] AR projects seem to lack informational, helper, curational stuff. 
- Useful concept memory palaces: loci
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci
- [[David Weinberger]] 
    - background in philosophy 
    - for past 30 years writing about the ways in which technology effects the ways we think about things. Focused on Machine Learning for the past 5 years. 
    - Working at Google on Ethics and AI
- [[David Weinberger]] - Writing Notes Process
    - Hobbyist programmer
    - Wrote app that lets me take notes in plain old [[ascii]] (text)
    - bibliographic info at top
        - page number, note and tag
    - took notes on a ton of info that way
    - then built an app that let me shunt it all into databases 
    - Went back to Zotero yesterday
        - Couldn't get it to work and it doesn't work the way I want it to. 
    - [yes](https:yes.com) 
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] 
    - I liked [[Endnote]] when someone else was paying for it. 
    - [[Zotero]] is great, not for me really because I'm no longer an academic, but lots of great ways to plug in to it to make it for me.
    - For arguing on the web, that's what I use context.center for. 
- [[Chris Aldrich]]: 
    - Mendeley seems to be shutting down
    - Zotero is useful for annotating PDFs and now does export of notes from .pdfs as of version 6.0
- [[Jerry Michalski]] big charts and zooming in and out of them is one of the problems we need to take on. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]] 
    - [[Harvard Growth Lab]] has an amazing infographic about economics
        - https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/
- Reminds me of - https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder
- [[Cesar Hidalgo]] - https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/
- What do we take on next? Agenda for next week:
    - How to explain the shared memory concept? 
    - A lot of different answers. 
    - Maybe understanding what the technical format is for a "memory" so it can be shared effectively. 
- Where are the YouTube listings of our calls?
    - In Jerry's brain 
    - In the Mattermost chat 

### Action items / #TODO

- [ ] invite others
    - who?
    - if we write it down in a canonical place we can distribute this (useful, social) work
- [ ] set up cross-review?
    - [[flancian]] would be willing and glad to review other people's writing, perhaps we could do this as a group?
        - full disclosure: I'm also writing a chapter :)
        - Always glad to read and make suggestions! - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
- What else might we publish? Potentially on the site
- [ ] [[let's share notes]]
    - [ ] start integrating pattern languages
        - [ ] build a [[meta pattern language]]
