        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[jerry michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space
    - it should allow all users to view data through their chosen tools
    - sometimes you change tools as you shift what you need to do (they are good at different modes of thinking)

    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
