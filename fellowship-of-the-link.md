        - this could support/enable a social feature (through ActivityPub or AtProto)
        - on atproto vs activitypub
            - ActivityPub better for social networking itself
                - [[betula]] example for non-microblogging functionality
                - scaling is still a pain with AP
            - Atproto more sensible in some ways though
                - Like the PDS approach
        - #AZS maybe nostr is the right technical answer, but the community has downsides
            - and at this point social networks just decline
        - Opportunity for "commons first solution that can make use of vault/archive data"

    - Fires
    - Starting the year
- Brain being rewritten for the Xth time
- Idea: using AI to refactor/rewriting/making old code shinier
    - Aram: it's still far from being autonomous/decouplable. Some experiences with a python codebase it works great, little experiance with Rust as a codebase and it is useless to me.
    - Flan: +1 totally.
    - On resistance by engineering organizations, and the need for someone with domain expertise to review/validate.
    - Mathew: it could work great for transpiling, updating, refining. A company could become an expert in applying genAI in partnership with those who understand the existing product and code.
    - A lot of platforms / tools / profiles of labor will mutate with AI use 
    - On the kind of development processes this unlocks

    - Would running extra relays reduce the load on existing ones?
        - We have different understandings
        - On [[shared heaps]]
        - With Bluesky you can remove yourself from the network and take away all your data
- On Meta's policy changes and fallout
    - Flan: this sent the Fediverse into a heated reaction, understandably. https://wiki.social.coop/wiki/Federation_with_Threads and https://www.loomio.com/d/u1OkUA6M/clarity-on-stance-with-regards-to-threads/30.

        - The Cairo Genizah is a collection of Jewish manuscript fragments discovered in the genizah (storage room) of the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Fustat (Old Cairo), Egypt. These documents, accumulated over a millennium, provide invaluable insights into the social, economic, and religious life of the Jewish community in the medieval Middle East. The genizah was discovered in 1896 and has since been a crucial source for scholars studying Jewish history and culture.

        - [[Peter Kaminski]] - (following on from Aram) Nostr the protocol is solid, the Nostr community is mostly crypto-focused. You could build a "winning" app on Nostr protocol, but you'd have to do the very substantial work of creating the social fabric and the communities of communities that run on it

        - Questions/feedback
            - Can we integrate this massivewiki, given that both use markdown as a source of truth?

            - How to set up one of your own?
            - How to contribute new items or comment/engage?
            - Long covid icon could be clearer; icons could surface the category on hover (use title property?)

                - https://github.com/tweetback
                - my example: https://tweets.aramzs.com 
            - very nice!
            - would it be actually useful to offer this as a service? given that social media is so recency-biased
            - #CA reddits and forums also deal with the lack-of-wikiness (e.g. newcomers ask the same questions over and over again)
                - it would be cool to go from 'I've been writing things on twitter for years' to 'here is a narrative/a neobook/a story based on my writing'

## [[2024-07-17]]
- Attending: [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Chris Aldrich]] [[Flancian]]
- [[Jitsi]] recording is on
- Digital [[Syphons]] as an idea
    - On the one hand it makes sense to keep copies of a lot of what we see
    - But what about e.g. watching a movie? Would that give you the right to share the recording? It seems not (currently).
    - Chris on how the entertainment industry is shaped by this question and current events.
        - [[Streaming]] as a factor
        - [[Piracy]]
            - Example of a company recently shut down that was doing piracy on large scale as a service
        - #PK maybe we're going into a future in which we'll have:
            - lots of derived work based on previous work, e.g. a million star wars
            - interactive experiences
        - [[Mashups]] enhanced by AI
            - Less creativity due to derivative nature
            - But more creativity in the sheer audacity of the combinations possible?
            - #PK precedent in what happened once studio level recording/editing became widely available 
                - [[Billy Eilish]] (sp?)
        - AI derived work maybe doesn't have the 'cultural commonality' sapect of current artifacts
            - #PK but we can expect a few creators to be 'outliers', widely followed, providing commonality
            - Influencers
            - Explosion in cultural context may result in context collapse -- or just something different
            - Ingroups / see communities around influencers with their own memes
            - #PK yet AIs could also be guides to such communities
            - [[Extension 765]]
   - #PK from an org I'm part of, something to consider if you're in California: "Please sign these letters to legislators, telling them that misguided AI laws will hurt startups and small companies and discourage AI innovation and investment in California." https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR5VrXxDJA3sJtkWDAKLH1TT0havDxmCf9PYAupxECu1BQYw/viewform
       - Oligarchy -> where the rich get to write the rules?
       - #CA "The factory cannot only look at the profit index. It must distribute wealth, culture, services, democracy. I think factory for man, not man for factory, right? The divisions between capital and labour, industry and agriculture, production and culture must be overcome. Sometimes, when I work late I see the lights of the workers working double shifts, the clerks, the engineers, and I feel like going to pay my respects." — [[Adriano Olivetti]]
       - Typewriters and degrading industrial quality, planned obsolescence
       - #PK The [[Matthew effect]] of accumulated advantage, sometimes called the Matthew principle, is the tendency of individuals to accrue social or economic success in proportion to their initial level of popularity, friends, and wealth. It is sometimes summarized by the adage or platitude "the rich get richer and the poor get poorer". The term was coined by sociologists Robert K. Merton and Harriet Zuckerman in 1968 and takes its name from the Parable of the Talents in the biblical Gospel of Matthew. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect
       - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect as it applies to typewriter
       - #F on the form earlier: it would be nicer to have something richer that lets you both support and oppose arbitrary proposals.
           - #AZS [[HOPE]] had a session on this
               - [[polis]]:

    - there will be a paywall
    - on the [[productivity equation]] of AI:
        - AI gives a significant productivity boost
        - so it should make it easy to give away a good fraction of content
        - lots of recent but by now historical data -- e.g. how to best prompt a one year old model
            - could make for good content to publish (on a delayed schedule)
    - the [[newspaper paywall]] model could also apply/have advantages
        - free articles and gifting the obligation of signing up to read them

    - For those concerned that talking about catastrophic risks will hurt efforts to mitigate short-term human-rights issues with AI
    - For those concerned with the US-China cold war
    - For those who think that international treaties will not work

We killed a lobster in our kitchen last night and my daughter cried for an hour. The Japanese, who used to be just about the fiercest people on earth, have become infatuated with cuddly adorable cartoon characters. My own family--the people I know best--is divided about evenly between people who will probably read this essay and people who almost certainly won't, and I can't say for sure that one group is necessarily warmer, happier, or better-adjusted than the other."

- [[Flancian]]
    - Introspection and soul searching :)
- [[Peter Kaminski]]
    - Doing well and making progress on how to deliver educational content
    - Epiphany with GenAI
        - When "most" people can generate e.g. images via GenAI, where does that leave the creator/curator/etc.?
        - The understanding of the craft is still valuable; the role might be helping people make better images/work with creative tools better
        - How will niches evolve with these changes?
            - Some people are very good at writing prompts
            - Some people have very good ideas
            - Some people are very good at 'finishing'/touching up
    - [[movies]] <-> [[games]] spectrum
    - [[David]], CEO of [[Midjourney]]:
        - [[davidh]], [[David Holz]]

        - [[Marc-Antoine Parent]] - knowing the "edges" of a dataset, and knowing if/when the AI is reaching "outside" of the edges
    - Interesting question the second
        - Corpus gathering
            - Original source data
            - Synthetic data
                - [[Nemotron-4 340B]], an open-source pipeline for generating synthetic data. 98 percent of the training data used to fine-tune the Instruct model is synthetic and was created using Nvidia's pipeline.

            - #PK doesn't use them (do they exist yet?) because the top-of-the-line models (e.g. [[gpt 4o]] currently) are good enough in most aspects
            - #F But what if other models were optimistically/lazily surfaced? :)
            - It is true that sometimes you know that your model isn't doing as good as it could do (e.g. with coding)

                    - We became unreasonably good at throwing by being bad at throwing, and then bootstrapped into having the right neuronal structures evolving for precision timing of throws. Those neural structures could then be coopted for intelligence, music, speech, etc.

            - need a hook into people's attention (paraphrasing)
            - the "easiest" (or most common and socially accepted currently) way of solving both is publishing a book
            - respect for the [[POSSE]] but unsure it works for this specific problem -- except for [[Cory Doctorow]]. But even he didn't start that way. It is a solution intended for online identity as an object.  
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] something that leads people to discover the thing themselves, so they want my help with it 
            - #AZS 
                - I sorta think the answer lies somewhere in documenting the history of the thing 
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] parallels between the publishing industry and the studio system, which is mostly owned by corporations for which making films is a secondary concern (e.g. Sony is an electronics company first).
            - One of the questions that publishing houses ask is: 'who already cares about you'.

    - [[SJ]] lots of companies spend their $ on user or society surplus.  on average, most companies don't survive.  the itnersection of those that invest in public surplus and those survive decreases over time... if you weather a downturn you probably cut out most areas of surplus.  and it's rare that it comes back 
    - SJ says:but coops are also companies and often defined in terms of helping one another survive downturns. let's design future orgs and systems from good models

    - The [[BFDL]] concept as it applies to this project :)
    - Reference [[neobook]]/first [[neobook]]
    - [[nuggetization]]
        - how it relates to translating between [[worldviews]]
        - The difficulty of finding editors to work with to help work them into neobooks 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
        - it seems likely that [[nuggets]] that are intended to be used within a [[neobook]] are going to be even harder to integrate elsewhere once "enhanced" by AI
        - AI will tend to 'overwrite' towards a particular problem
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] would agree, and in the case we're discussing the AI expansion made the end result harder to process. But AI in general seems like a powertool: it can be used with skill and make you go faster, but they can get out of control.
        - [[Flancian]] on maybe defining nugget as 'human written' or at least 'full of human meaning/curated by a human'.
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] have you thought about going from Agora nodes to books/other format?

             - #SJ https://publicai.network and https://gen.studio
                 - have been running a seminar for people building infrastructure
                 - people from a dozen countries working on their own projects
                 - there's definitely potential in this
                 - let's start a stone soup
             - #JM should we start a plan?
                 - +1
                 - #SJ I like starting with a namespace
                     - in order to call it a commons we need to:
                         - have a namespace
                         - a mechanism for classifying
                     - people seem interested in participating in a commons in general, but we need to have one we can point to as successful
                     - it probably needs to be as general as possible, close to just a set of thing
                 - the [[generative commons]] could include:
                     - [[corpora]]
                     - [[generated outputs]]
                 - the default interface could be a playground connecting sources, prompts to outputs
                     - [[prompt router]] with flows to contribute back to the commons
             - #JM my approach was very intentional
             - #PK pays for [[stealth mode]] in [[midjourney]]
             - #SJ whatever this commons is, it should be a good place to develop alternatives to services provided by corporations

    - [[dxos]]: https://dxos.org
- Topics from last time
    - [[autopoiesis]]
    - [[neobooks]]
- [[collective authoring]] as distinct from the basics of [[book publishing]]
    - the default sort of social interaction so far for neobooks are github/git forge fork-and-send-PRs
    - are there any less geeky ways to contribute/interact?
        - commenting systems
        - [[hypothes.is]]
    - do we need an analog for copy-and-paste for how to collaborate in a distributed mesh of documents?
        - [[conflict resolution]] is one part of this
        - we can check the variety of wikis that are built on top of [[git]] plus [[markdown]] plus [[wikilinks]]
    - there is a reason we end up with git as a backend; the alternatives are more computationally expensive, require servers or parties to run software.
    - [[google docs]] as a model maybe -- the comments-only access is something we might want an equivalent for
        - [[etherpad]]
        - something built on [[crdt]]

    - #AZS wish there were different models of federation
        - on being more focused on being broadcasters than collectors
    - #CA how do we map thousands of years of social evolution onto the possibilities of digital communities
        - [[the internet con]] by [[doctorow]] makes the case that we should go towards smaller distributed communities that can make their decisions
        - on how choosing an instance or platform is also about choosing what one wants to signal (or broadcast)
        - [[posse]] lets you pick and choose which communities you cross-post to; if you're [[indieweb]] first you probably don't care as much about the visibility that one single instance has over the rest of the fediverse
        - #AZS people are not necessarily posting on social media with the assumption that everybody will care; they assume there is in practice a small neighborhood. That is true until it isn't (see e.g. unexpected virality)
        - #JM about [[boundaries]]: a well functioning group understands its boundaries and its norms
            - and expectations

  - [[Dan Allosso]]
- [[Intimacy Gradient]]
    - Expectations around where and when you expect people to engage with you. 
    - Maybe we could carry our own 'terms of service' / privacy and engagement settings in a platform-agnostic way
    - #CA media has adapted and changed in its standards as well; newspapers in the early 20th century had completely different standards w.r.t. privacy expectations than towards the end.
    - On evolving [[civility standards]]
        - [[Trump]] exploiting this

        - [[curl]] was hanging
            - wasn't specifying 'don't search full text' thing, it was super slow
            - full text search doesn't really seem to work in the Brain API
            - will try to report the bug to tech support
            - the idea is to make gpt call the brain api

    - [[aram zucker-scharff]] [Aggregation, Amplification, and Archiving - Fellowship of the Link](https://fightwithtools.dev/posts/writing/aggregation-amplification-and-archiving/)
        - [[comment section]] is just github issues
        - would love all feedback/responses!
    - [[Flancian]] cheated and made my nugget the node [[nuggets]] in the Agora :)
        - https://anagora.org/nuggets is/will be a list of all known nuggets we mention
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] on the [[Dahlonega Nugget]], a newspaper in a gold rush town :)
        - His daughter named a stuffed racoon toy she got there "Nugget"
    - [[Peter Kaminski]] some feedback on [[nugget]] as a name, from a conversation with other people:
        - too concrete
        - and too "[[nounish]]" and not "[[verbish]]" enough
            - or, too much of an object, and not enough of a process
            - [The (Hopi) World According to Whorf](https://azorion.tripod.com/whorf.htm)
        - what would the verb be?
            - part of it would be an adjective, "composable" (and thence, decomposable)
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] also got some feedback on the focus on the book aspect -- maybe it's good to recenter from the object to the community
            - Note though that verb-centric languages are a minority
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] related dissonance in the note taking space and the tension between different "levels" (e.g. from note to section to book)
            - Everybody's perspective will be different
            - How do you reuse a whole chapter?
                - [[Jerry]] Chapter size would be too large likely. They might be 
        - [[Flancian]] maybe similar
            - and types
            - [[node]] as verb from [[everything2]]
            - [[Jerry]] on mediawiki
                - [[flancian]] on [[semantic mediawiki]]
                - [[Jerry]] some experiences in the past, was turned off by page renaming not rippling back -- some clunkyness
                - [[Peter Kaminski]] set it up :)
                - [[Chris Aldrich]] on the tradeoff between flexibility and complexity (and clunkiness)
                    - Example from [[drupal]]
- [Ben Werdmuller to Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/people/ben-werdmuller)
- Meta/vocabulary check on whether we want to iterate on the [[nugget]] terminology.
    - Pro: something valuable and small-ish; memorable.
    - #PK in feedback it seems like people might focus on different attributes; what is key to me from the thing is the [[composability]]
    - [[Jerry]] [[mother]] from [[SCOBY]]
    - [[legos]] but better?
    - planting seeds and [[grafting]]?
    - threads and knitting, weaving
    - [[quipus]]
        - different
        - but in the same "universe"
    - [[pearls]] (as nuggets of value) and [[purls]] (as in [[purl stitch]])
    - [[pattern]]?
        - too large
    - [[particle]]
    - would [[fragment]] describe it?
        - it makes it seem as it's incomplete
    - an [[x]], or a [[nugget]]:
        - is [[complete]] yet [[composable]]
    - How does this notion relate to the concept of neobook? Should we use something which is a book-related metaphor?
    - #CA or from the idea of playlists, call them "music"
    - #CA [[thesaurus]] as 'repository for treasure'
    - [[jewels]] and [[indra's net]]
    - [[trichobezoars]] and [[ambergris]]

- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Flancian]] [[Chris Aldrich]] [[Michael Grossman]] [[Bentley Davis]] [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] [[Peter Kaminski]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] and [[Peter Kaminski]] on a productive call about [[massive wiki]] and lots more!
    - Next Wednesday is [[Massive Wiki Wednesday]]
    - 1h30m later than this call
    - Will cover the future of Massive Wiki
- Could we have a dashboard of all [[calls]] in our space
    - #PK has something Google Sheets based, using Sheets as a grid/table editor
        - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjSuYW1xChKJNCLK_cyMjJO_Ejc53RDYwRcvtRONLY0/edit
        - Pete is proud of the timezone legend columns at the left
        - stopped updating in Sheets because some boxes and their borders span multiple cells; like overall look, but need a better grid editor that is better at multiple cell boxes
    - Present as a neobook?
        - Shared agenda
- [[Flancian]]
    - Open letters and neobooks 
    - Looking at open letters in history
    - https://bra.in/2jM4Qe
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - How is it different from a viral post
- [[Flancian]]
    - Intention
    - Notion of who is reading 
    - Some level of meta awareness 
    - There are some similarities
    - Neobooks and how they connect 
        - Same shape as an Agora node
        - Open letters are hugely interesting. 
        - They get amplified with history
        - Similarly new media 
        - The internet evolves similar 
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - Also a useful characteristic to think of for both neobooks and open letters is portability
        - +1, and publishing has been a key factor in which open letters became popular/"successful" for a purpose in the past. MLK's publishing story is interesting
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - composability 
    - https://bra.in/3jgE2p 
    - Manifestos - too many authors have robbed them of a degree of their potency? 
- [[Aram]] an interesting characteristic of open letters:
    - in modern times open letters are implied to have many authors, or have been created with a degree of anonymity 
    - [[letter on corpulence]] :)
    - on expanding circles of trust
    - [[google docs]] as defacto publishing platform
    - #JM about inspirations for [[neobooks]]
        - [[nuggets]] are supposed to be small yet valuable
        - [[indra's net]]
            - -> [[fritjof capra]]
            - -> the fear
        - [[glass bead game]]
            - -> [[neuromancer]]
        - are [[neobooks]]:
            - [[nuggets]] as objects
                - they have [[metadata]]
                - and [[ordering]]
            - [[linked]] 
            - and [[transcluded]]?
        - [[anything missing]]?
            - aggregation?
                - MVP is: a new nugget which transcludes everything in a list
            - Ordering?
            - Contexting?
                - Can be seen as 1. composition and 2. a type system.
            - [[extraclusion]]
                - 'take this part of this page and publish it there'
                - this sounds a lot like [[push]] in the Agora
            - ability to include/exclude e.g. headers
                - rich contextual snippets -- [[oembed]] like
                - embed modes? Full, [[oembed]], brief? 
            - would like to conceptually transclude or aggregate a number of pages, and I want that to be the corpus or knowledge base for a chat bot
                - throw a [[lasso]] around a set of nuggets and produce something with them
                - -> like a doc, to begin with simply
                - -> [[fruiting bodies]]
                    - leads back to the notion of multiple language levels on top of languages, which we have covered before
                    - neobooks are Mushrooms from The Big Fungus - https://app.thebrain.com/brain/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/51b0b67d-d333-435d-af18-7f0194683289
                - -> on context as user set prompt
             - [[open letters]] in the brain: https://app.thebrain.com/brain/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/a030353f-c917-3d29-fc19-70912f8aef80
             - See assignment section below -> let's all produce one [[nugget]] for next week? something having to do with the fellowship directly or indirectly :)
- which direction to go to now?
    - [[nugget a week]]
        - [[webmentions]] would be ideal
            - [[bridgy fed]] by [[snarfed]]
                - some concerns about the difficulty of self-hosting
                - for now some consider it a SPOF
                - ideal model could be: something that works like nostr, where you can just point your system to a set of bridgy fed instances and it balances
        - we can start by posting to the mattermost challenge -- links to anything
        - [[IETF]]: a protocol is not ready until you have two independent implementations
            - the maybe-problem of [[Mastodon]]
                - [[Mastodon]] copies Twitter too much
                - [[Mastodon]] does not do enough
            - [[twitter is not a microphone]] https://www.schizochronotopia.com/p/on-twitter-we-look-down 
                - [[meta]] on [[substack]] as a hosting platform
                    - [[micro.blog]] as federated alternative maybe?
                    - c.f. something open like  https://github.com/tsileo/microblog.pub ?
                    - what about the [[payment]] aspect of it? it's important for many writers.
                    - [[ghost]] is very opinionated engineering
                        - #PK observes that Ghost has a great post editing interface, and the email newsletter distribution works well
                    - [[beehiiv]] is also focused on newsletters
                    - [[buttondown]]
                    - [[aram]] on the challenges of independent tools in this space -- in particular the problem of email deliverability (negotiating automated anti-spam false positives as it affects newsletters)

- [[flancian]] presentation (maybe): https://anagora.org/go/agora-slides
    - three facets 
        - a space - the definition of an agora the one best known 
            - public, mostly virtual, but has semi public sub-spaces (stoas). Different groups met in the different spaces and allowed people to join in and be part of something. 
            - Go beyond the commons concern of the market 
        - A distributed knowledge graph 
            - Give it a list or repositories or resources and the agora will try to mash them together, find connections, find patterns, connect them. 
        - A social network
            - an integration between social graphs and knowledge graphs and hopefully will make it part of the fediverse and t/f give it a clearer part of the social network concept. 
    - Both a vision and a hypothesis 
        - pro-social subsets of the internet would benefit from wide availability of a free [[interlay]] (as in the [[underlay project]]) provisioned and governed by a community as a commons. 
        - For the common good. 
        - Follow the principles of a commons. 
        - Develop tools and instructions to make it more likely that such a connective layer arrises with these characteristics. 
        - The agora is not good enough yet to be the connective layer but aims to be a bootstrap. 
    - Note taking, wiki building, web annotating, communities, seem to have unique opportunity at hand. Possible to self-organize in cooperative groups and set up ways to federate within a commons. 
    - Find common patterns and exploit them using the system where we can. 
    - Design principles 
        - Simple as possible 
        - Leverage existing conventions and formats 
        - bootstrap and build better ones from the bootstrap
    - Key characteristics 
        - free software enabling a community to provision a basic knowledge commons 
        - requires little of would be integrators and give back generously to participating communities. 
        - inclusive and makes use of existing conventions, formats, tools, and networks for as long as practical. 
    - Architecture 
        - Agora Bridge
            - Software
            - User repositories 
            - Social media 
            - ...
            - Imports users' repositories every 30s and handles them. Usually git. Takes MassiveWiki and Social Media  
        - Agora root repository 
            - List of repositories 
            - Configuration and bootstrap procedures 
            - Base content 
        - Agora Server 
            - Software
            - Web interface 
            - Interlink procedures 
            - Accessed by browser 
            - Python and Flask server 
            - Points to a root repository and with those resources attempt to find the patterns and pull out nodes which then get served to the user. 
            - May present notes on the same node by different users across different contexts. 
    - Node 
        - High level entity
        - Location on the knowledge graph 
        - Can hold information from multiple users and join different files 
        - Node can have Subnodes by different authors. 
        - Links in Nodes will be seen and link those nodes together at the Agora level. 
        - Nodes are social 
        - See anagora.org/nodes for visualization 
        - Common patterns:
            - [[Digital Garden Note]]
            - [[Blog Post ]]
            - [[Personal Wiki Page]] 
            - [[Journal]] 
            - [[Node Club]]
        - You can agree on a slice for a concept and then right away start coordinating - exactly like using a hashtag 
            - Socail media works with hashtags to integrate into this concept. 
            - Agora lets you hashtag anywhere 
    - Stoas 
        - Social too
        - Locaitons that act as semi public spaces
        - Set up a hedge doc that is totally anonymous. 
        - Will get processed into the Angora within 30 sec. 
        - Etherpad and Jitsi both can get pulled in to a Stoas. 
    - Heavily uses iFrames whenever possible 
    - Default empty pages are a call to action
    - How to join!
        - Take notes in your fav tool
        - Publish in platform - usually git. 
        - Let an Agora maintainer know about it. 
    - Wikilinks everywhere 
        - Edges are [[wikilinks]] which refer to other nodes as found in volunteered subnodes 
    - Idea of composing notes 
        - Some notes have special behavior 
        - [[go]] notes - `#go url` or `[[go/foo]]`
        - [[pull]] - bring in the resource at bar with `#pull bar`
        - [[push]] - push out the resource to foo with `#push foo`

        - itinerant "software salesman" :)
        - focused on helping people solve problems with software
        - one pitch for the group: son-in-law works on book.io which is a publishing environment that tries to empower authors
            - unique covers for each of the books (NFT space, in the cardano chain)

- [[does chatgpt obsolete notetaking]]
    - [[AZS]] typical AI-disruption-take.
        - These are tools for thinking and not just for ingestion.
        - our computers/mobile phones already turn us into cyborgs; AI just adds another layer to this
        - human intervention is what gives these things/outputs a value
    - [[CA]] note taking is a ratchet
        - "chat-gpt, build me something like the ethereum network to distribute books"
            - we're not anywhere near there yet.
            - "what is the next thing", in the sense of Einstein in 1904, is not something that this level of AI can solve.
        - [[JM]] unclear on whether LLMs can only regurgigate known things or can actually improve on them -- compare with e.g. alphago coming up with novel moves
    - [[Michael Grossman]] podcast: https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/a-true-second-brain-xrODaBD2
        - on [[Nat Eliason]]
        - being able to take notes over years and put them into a model which you can then query/search
        - a certain type of note taking will be much more useful than in the old days
        - surfacing the note that somebody you trust has shared with you is what's golden
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] when Google came out, we outsourced our memories to Google
        - proponent of humans-in-the-loop
        - [[AZS]] [[technology is a tool, not an outcome]]
    - [[David Pickrell]] recording/transcription services you can add to meetings.
        - using [[ChatGPT]] can help get a sense of material but might not help actually learn that material
        - [[JM]] [[story threads]]
    - [[AZS]] wikipedia is essentially the biggest collection of knowledge, yet people also get degrees

        - Yes :D
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] AI as it is now is interesting but it lacks:
            - a [[compass]].
            - a [[ratchet]].
                - it can aggregate/conglomerate but it won't choose a solution or direction for you.

        - Read [[Engelbart]] over the summer and it was very interested in the context of GenAI developments/this conversation

        - Maybe on defining a [[default commons]] as an advantage for a group that tries this
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
        - The libertarian concept of finding an answer is what we get by default nowadays: different websites compete to provide the "best answer"

                - https://chat.openai.com/share/3d3e3f93-9449-420a-914f-bc27c4912a49
                    > In the late 1850's, "Virchow was the first to correctly link the origin of cancers from otherwise normal cells, believing that cancer is caused by severe irritation in the tissues (the ‘chronic irritation theory’). Not all of his work was correct, however. He also proposed that cancer spreads around the body by the spread of the irritation in liquid form."

> I have had the uncomfortable impression that the space of decentralized projects is constantly reinventing Git-like concepts under different names. So I am personally going to explore how much we can directly leverage Git rather than reinventing eventually-consistent databases and reconciliation protocols. 

- question
    - git is amazing and we love it, it is awesome, etc. -- we love it.
    - however it's an obstacle for massivewiki -- great for 85% of cases but breaking the remainder of 15%
    - a recent obsidian experiment was accumulating frustrations -- until we switched to obsidian sync and all woes went away
    - note [[massive wiki builder]] is now [[massive wiki publisher]]
    - what is your experience with [[git]]?
        - [[jerry michalski]]: too arcane to use.
    - question :)
        - maybe we don't need all the fancy stuff of git?
        - [[syncthing]] is not good enough -- our use case is same files + version log of them
    - is it crazy to ditch git and try to roll our own service for syncing?
        - [[flancian]] default answer: yes :) we should try to better package/complement git first
        - this could also do auto-merge of wiki-like "conflicts"
- [[michael grossman]] paradigms for information gathering and dealing with the notion that we live in [[push world]]
    - moderation and filtering are our best efforts now
    - but what we really want is a [[pull world]] -- where we make available what we want to share, and we choose what we want in our timelines (opt-in)

    - [[Chris Aldrich]] on the idea of critical thinking as layered on top of christianity, which caused the earlier to go into a very specific direction
        - Q: do democracies require critical thinkers?
- [[Go links]]!
    - #SJ there is a version of these in [[xanadu]] and in [[early wikis]]
    - for some reason we stopped thinking of browsers as a place to do additional/indirection/substitution work
    - Gather examples somewhere to talk of what we can do with them and how they work? 
    - As a means of search 
    - Resolution of websites more broadly? 
    - Customizing your cascade of Go providers as a method of search? 
        - [[flancian]] +100
    - Could be useful for resolving non traditional URLs like Hyper, Gemini, Onion, etc... 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] MVP Idea: 
        - List your Go Link resolvers with any URL your browser can resolve
        - They provide /go/x mapping 
        - Browser extention pulls autocomplete from a sitemap of the /go/x providers and lets you store local /go/x links. 
        - Does this exist? 
        - Could expand to archiving the links as well and then the /go/x provider checks if the links are live and decides to route you to the live or archived link.
   - Previous experiences with Go links in the group?
       - Peter Kaminski has some in the shape of interwiki links
       - SisterSites has some similarities with this and interwiki links
       - Could we build these on top of e.g. nostr or ActivityPub
           - Yes, definitely
   - On link.agor.ai and how it provides go links already if you want to try :)
       - Trying out adding my own system - https://github.com/flancian/link.agor.ai/pull/1/files
 
            
## [[2023-07-19]] ?
- [[SJ]] waving hello remotely. 
    - Added a thread to follow up on, above.  As part of that: I'd like to have a clear standard for hub/cascade-based resolution that can be referenced at https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Go_links (perhaps w/ cross-references to how DNS and package-resolution and other routing specs do this)
    - Also looking to formalize how we link different global entity graphs (System.com, Golden, proprietary graphs, Wikidata), formalize how well-sourced each statement is (via an explicit Wikicite w/ metadata about confidence + contextual applicability), and either declare similarity + crosswalks b/t them (A is meant to be a copy of B; A is derived from B,C, and judgement) or indicate none is known
    - Haven't forgotten the postcard art project, but it was delayed by a house move !

    - Aram: Changes in the acceptable behavior in Zoom meetings. 
    - On strapping a macbook to your face :)
    - Price might be high because they want to go after rich people, executives, bosses, trend setters
    - Michael Grossman: the choice architecture and price is such that it distinguishes them from meta/occulus
    - Peter Kaminski: the face hugger 
    - Aram: I think it is about the pieces more than the whole, once your boss gets a vertual self everyone will want one and once you get a hang of gesture control, everyone will want that, much healthier than being stuck with a mouse and keyboard.

    - Types:
        - transclude
        - copy
        - copy and link
- [[Flancian]]
    - on transclusion and copying as they are supported by [[agora server]] and [[agora bridge]] currently
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - How to have cross-tool or tool-agnostic collaboration?
- [[Flancian]]
    - Proposal: a protocol for forking and merging text, plus tools that make it accessible for less-technical-users?

    - Is [[OGM]] the right umbrella term here?
    - [[Peter Kaminski]]
        - We probably want to consider an entity with some governance structure
            - [[flotilla]] for example
        - [[FOTL]]
        - [[OGM]] subverts the idea of an organization structure :)

        - There's https://zettelkasten.eu and a dedicated reddit
    - #ca On [[building a second brain]] getting very popular, to the extent it's muddied the waters of what is a very long historical tradition
        - Prefer to approach the space starting from the basics (keeping it simple / with a minimal set of rules)
        - You need to be clear on why you're doing zettelkasten-like, what is the expected output
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] https://forum.obsidian.md/tag/zettelkasten and [Honest Alternatives to Zettelkasten \- Knowledge management \- Obsidian Forum](
https://forum.obsidian.md/t/honest-alternatives-to-zettelkasten/57076/5)

- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Flancian]] [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] [[Chris Aldrich]] [[Michael Grossman]] [[Samuel Klein]]
- What's the common thread we want to pursue?

        - https://mapofthefuture.org/
        - https://wiki.mapofthefuture.org/
        - https://lionsberg.wiki/
        - the above inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation
    - The framing project
        - https://wiki.earthmoonstars.space/
        - It's totally fine if things are generated by AI, as long as there is a person curating
    - The actual pitch -- going off people / project roles pages in https://wiki.earthmoonstars.space/project_roles
        - Now about the org structure
            - Contributors
                - Contribute :)

                - 1h in an editorial meeting ~ 2 stories
        - Q&A and comments
            - love the framing of a wiki and associated narrative as MVP for coordination on a project
            - why six roles / might they be too many?
                - tradeoff between making it clear how people can contribute/engage, recognizing different types of work, and manageability
        - [[Jerry Michalski]]
            - Issue of overhead of platform choice/coordination  
            - Examples of projects in this space
                - Distributed Accounting of Value Flows (Revenue Sharing for Collaboration)

        - [[Metasj]]

                - Recognize value of contributions and distribute earnings/profits/outcomes
                - #pk see lots of projects which don't have enough of a framework to let people contribute in different ways
                - #pk c.f. lionsberg -- connecting donors and dollars with the right nonprofits. interface layer.
        - #azs what does state mean in the description given?
            - #pk the US state in this case because I'm sitting there and US non profits are regulated by the US state; other states would apply.
            - This is a fallback mechanism thought.
            - #jm [[escheat]]
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] like the fact that this is working towards diversity/inclusion; allowing people that wouldn't usually have access to the system and get it
            - But wonder if this kind of system will always be open to people figuring out incentive/reward structures and exploiting them.
            - [[Gresham's law]] ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law
        - [[Jerry Michalski]]
            - Would be nice for communities to be able to select templates/override values from other projects to lower the cost to setup.
        - [[Samuel Klein]] ([[Metasj]])
            - There's day-to-day decisions vs larger strategic decisions
            - People often tie governance to assets
            - Enjoy the idea of a system where people can self-assign roles and report back on time/effort invested
            - [[Jerry Michalski]] you could have people vote on each other's value contributed

    - #when Wednesdays at [[6PM UTC]]
- Attending: [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] [[flancian]]
- [[Peter Kaminski]] on [[complexity adventures]] this past weekend
    - #pk a little bit like [[OGM]], fuzzy organization but maybe a bit less than OGM :)
    - https://www.complexityadventures.com/
    - came out of [[complexity science]] community. It used to be called [[complexity week]]
    - 2x year a summit
        - [[wrap-up session]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTS6IokWQZM&list=PLcZI4kcFpRsjQoktPXJ1cbKlb1MdSlirw
    - they host it in [[gather town]] -- and it worked this weekend, quite well. People dropped by on discussions.
    - session for an hour, break for an hour -- repeat for 48h
    - 1/3rd new people every summit; basecamps take place every month after each summit for people who agreed to work on the same project
    - more structure (than OGM) means they have more of a shared language
    - they run everything on [[keybase]] (instead of e.g. [[mattermost]]) -- "every app grows until it can send email -> chat"
        - aside on [[jwz]] and his rants :)
        - mention of [[steve yegge]]
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] parallel conversation on building a shared brain / collective sense. Convergent lines.
        - Mention of [[mycelial networks]] in the conference
        - [[network of the future]]
        - reusing infrastructure
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] on [[quorum1]]: https://wiki.quorum.one/blog/what-is-quorum1
    - [[Flancian]] on federated work / moderation in the fediverse
    - [[Flancian]] is there a platform / organization that connects organizations in this space like we are doing peer to peer in this group?
        - LinkedIn suggests connections, complements the person-to-person processes
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] on the difficulty of transferring knowledge between knowledge bases, or maybe impossibility (currently)
            - writing down stuff doesn't make it knowledge, it needs to be decoded
        - But: [[Vincent Arena]], https://catalist.network/ is this :)
        - #pk shares the [[flotilla]] project with Vincent
        - #pk Vincent wants to build something user-friendly; but a directory of this sort might be hard to make user-friendly
        - #pk [[matchmakers]] might be needed to mediate between the directory and non technical/beginner users, like [[librarians]]
    - #pk [[collaborative tech alliance]] ~ [[cta]] are also in this space
        - https://www.collaborative.tech/
    - [[interop]] and multiple source support seem key for such an entity
        - [[flotilla]] wanted to tackle this
            - [[factr]] interop was a recurring topic
            - [[flotilla fridays]]
            - [[interop taskforce]]?

    - [[ida josefina]]
    - #azs [[indieweb]] -- organized around an ideological core
        - [[interop fund]]
        - checkout is currently "here's a bunch of data, good luck" -- this may change due to regulation
    - #pk two things that maybe contradict each other a bit
        - skepticism about interop fund
            - the incentives might align wrong here
            - IETF in the early 90s, in particular the IMAP interop effort
            - what worked was each IMAP software developer working on their own interop
            - [[Hoffman]] was amazingly good at this
            - [[Flancian]] alternatives: services provided in the commons, etc.
        - going back to org structure
            - premise: little groups of people doing good work don't have enough support in creating an org structure that people feel can contribute to meaningfully, have a say in governance, etc.
            - templates for coordinating collaboration; e.g. go to a catalog and pick organizational forms that are compatible
            - [[pattern languages]] for organizations
                - organization types per jurisdiction
            - organizations should be able to be e.g. three people coming together for a few weeks

- Peter: I know WordPress has a tool 
- Jerry: Tired of dealing with WordPress, had to deal with problems and hacking, and code issues with collaborators. 
- Aram: I find it has moved towards larger scale users.

    - Peter: yeah it is a scale thing. 
    - Aram: The fate of open projects in capitalism that have no intent other than "better".

    - [[Jerry]] how do we make this more accessible to non technical users?
        - Maybe interactive experience that lets people go from preferences to recommended tools?

- [[Jerry Michalski]] conversation with (sp?) [[Cal Shannon]], from [[www artist consortium]]
    - Into Stable Diffusion as of late, [[generative salon]]
    - "Can we connect generative AI to your brain?"
    - But Jerry uses links more than nodes
    - Flancian: this could be a good opportunity for an Agora-like approach were other people contribute nodes in the same graph, thus putting together a social corpus.
    - Experiment: take one or few [[braincasts]] (tours of sections of the brain)
    - Lack of [[Brain API]] hinders some of these efforts
        - [[Brainy McBrainface]] previously
- "One of the most cyborg people I know"
    - "The future world has a lot to do with becoming a good cyborg"

        - [[Chris Aldrich]] There's the idea of [[context collapse]]... how do we create a context ratchet which can find what we're missing and fill it in to allow us to move along? Teachers are good at doing this, but automating it is anything but easy. 
            - allowing people to participate both [[meaninfully]] and in a [[kind]] fashion
            - use a [[context ratchet]] to find a middle ground, or maybe new words/concepts that serve to build bridges?

- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Flancian]] [[Chris Aldrich]] [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]...
- https://wiki.rel8.dev/shared_notes_across_six_tools -- one of the big goals for 2023.
- Initial list of participants (invited):
    - Jerry Michalski
    - Flancian
    - Pete Kaminski
    - Bentley Davis
        - Doesn't currently follow a note taking system
    - Maggie Appleton
    - Chris Aldrich
    - Mathew Lowry
    - Aram Zucker-Scharff
        - Would be interested in exploring this from a common processes point of view, beyond the particular tool used
- [[Markdown on git]] as a simple common format/medium
- Low bar: everybody links to https://wiki.rel8.dev/shared_notes_across_six_tools and the way back
- [[flancian]] Agora demo + [[go/agora chapter]]
    - :)
    - [[pull]] is too similar to 'pull request' so it was a bit confusing at first
    - #ca the distinction with block references w.r.t. pull/push was the most useful framing heard so far
- [[Chris Aldrich]] ideal note taking flow:
    - markdown based
    - private by default, but allows for easy publishing?
        - currently using [[nested vaults]] with [[obsidian]]
    - hypothesis integration
        - some frustration with the hypothes.is API
    - syndicates to social media with a permalink
    - does not require many tools, trying to cut down on the number of moving pieces always
- [[Instagram]]
    - cut off access to [[Chris Aldrich]] for the nth time, which is one time too many
- [[Web annotation standard]]]
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - would like to publish his notebook
    - would like a static-pages-based solution, no server component
    - https://github.com/AramZS/notebook/blob/main/README.md is a recap of conventions we've discussed so far
    - [[markdown it]] https://fightwithtools.dev/posts/projects/devblog/retro-markdown-it/
- on [[go links]]
    - related: [[alfred app]] [[TextExpander]]

## 2023-03-01
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]] [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Flancian]] ...
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[My life as a cyborg]] (mentioned on Free Jerry's Brain on Monday)
    - April posted about it on LinkedIn
    - How do the following mix together?
        - Jerry's Brain
        - ChatGPT
        - Massive Wikis
        - Agoras
    - Hip Hop culture and sampling
        - Previously it was clamped down upon by the recording industry
        - But Hip Hop railed against it and came out on top
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] it might be that hip hop started sampling culture (was there much sampling before that?)
        - Maybe what happened: there was a clamp down and then people started paying for samples, the economic aspect followed
        - [[How sampling transformed music]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3TF-hI7zKc
        - Parallels to how now you can post copyrighted videos/music to Youtube, and monetization "just flows" to the copyright holder
    - Q: Why don't we have a network-based (federated, distributed, etc.) solution for flowing profits/dividends generally?
        - A: mostly probably because copyright holders don't want this, they want a more centralized approach (e.g. meet with Youtube).
    - On [[image generators]] and the associated problem
        - #pk people realized that there was an "asset" up for grabs that wasn't recognized as such: [[style]].
        - Artists seem more concerned about style copying than about copying individual artwork.
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] Style is what an experienced/fully developed artist develops in a way that is recognizable
        - c.f. [[essence]], which these engines seem to be able to latch on
    - [[Copyright Revolution]]
        - #jm [[Attribution]] is extremely important
            - Together with a distributed system for tipping/paying it forward to everybody involved in derivative works
        - [[Embracing Piracy]]
        - #pk agree on almost all except for the idea of paying someone because they were the "root node"
        - #fl [[Revolution Coin]] would give people this flexibility :)
        - #pk but human creativity is already a [[commons]] and it should be recognized as such
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_Fairey
        - #ca on attribution as key, and how we:
            - Don't attribute enough (you don't see marketing people or theater owners in movie credits)
            - Could we making more explicit ancillary actors in general
            - China example: after decades of work they're still at 60-70% of where they could be w.r.t. setting up actual distribution networks
        - #jk [[Distributed Accounting of Value Flows]] (Revenue Sharing for Collaboration) https://bra.in/7qeDBy
            - in this space:
                - [[open collective]]
                - [[disco coop]]
            - if this worked, you could drop your 'reward' for a movie in a shared pool and let the right distribution system do the work
     - [[sam klein]] "Any good Fellowship should include generative members"
         - How do we make good on the opportunity to have a more robustly fleshed out world of links, value flows, etc.?
         - [[automated communism]]
         - #ca we've been using [[fame]]; what is its value? does fame have value beyond a marketplace that puts value on fame?
             - [[spielberg]] can make any movie he wants because of fame; he is trading that for something else?
         - #pk [[fame]] as a proxy for respect from people
             - not fungible, might not necessarily feed you

             - we should be empowering people to start new variations of society
         - #jm what are our next two [[stacks]]? https://bra.in/5qnYm9
     - What do we *need* to influence this space going forward?
         - Should we start with a [[wishlist]]?
         - Which: devices, people, organizations would we need the support of to get such a project off the ground? Which "things" would

- (on OGM)
    - born in an [[email list]] ([[Google Group]])
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] on dynamics in mailing lists
        - noisy vs quiet people
            - this problem seems to be less severe in chat? in particular if you can create a new room next door -- people will find their spaces
            - "bloviating"
            - people not being introduced to [[netiquette]]
            - [[slack]] designed around many of the limitations of email (you can rename channels but not (easily) email threads, etc.)
        - email is the lingua franca / mcd tool (pro)
        - email is pretty poor as a conversational medium (con)
    - channels in CSC [[mattermost]] came later
    - [[mini list]]
    - [[chat gpt]] discussion
- email vs matrix vs activitypub vs ...
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] big generational gap with email, almost nobody millenial or younger wants to use email
    - There's also the parallel move from IRC to Slack or Discord :(
        - Note that the ToS for Slack doesn't allow to extract messages from the platform (!).
    - There's also the parallel move from e.g. [[phpbb]] to [[reddit]]/[[stack exchange]]; unclear if some conversations that used to happen in forums are even happening *somewhere* anymore?
    - Aram: where has [[asynchronous play]] gone?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: default settings from products (that e.g. either send notifications to email or not) count a lot here.
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] how to set up customized 'sweeps' (like personal workflows) and share them.
    - [[Aram]] Indieweb has a cross posting version of this that pulls in Discord, Matrix and IRC.

           - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[LATCH]]: Location, Alphabets, Time, Categories, Hierarchies 
           - Timelines left-to-right don't work that well on the web; Molly's approach is top-to-bottom/feed like and works great

- Flancian: would like to discuss [[cross posting]] / [[siphoning]] further some other meeting?

            
## 2023-02-15
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[Bentley Davis]], [[Flancian]], [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Start recording, we're currently using Jitsi and that works best with a [[Chromium]] based browser.
- Threads from last time we would like to pick up:
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] would like to generalize the archiving tool / link card generator he's been working on.
    - [[Flancian]] would like to discuss [[Interwiki]] links and the [[common hub]] approach for search and entity resolution
- #push [[fotl threads]]
    - define:
        - [[wiki]] / root URL
        - /now
        - [[issue tracker]] / [[project tracker]] URL
            - [[github]] by default?
- Check ins
    - [[invasion of the body snatchers]]
- [[calendar]] URL
    - [[jerry michalski]] https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/calendar/
    - [[bentley davis]] surprised at the sheet but also understandable
        - would like to maybe code a viewer for calendars/slot finder
    - [[flancian]] have been using [[nextcloud]] calendar for social.coop
- how to share notes right here, right now
    - [[jerry michalski]] who has opinions on how this should look?
        - MVP: [[markdown]] files on git, plus maybe some mechanism to handle conflicts or at least handle contention
        - Some concerns with Obsidian vaults, and the fact that settings seem to be per-vault
        - MVP doesn't currently include sharing all the links in [[the brain]].
            - Would be nice to be able to infer [[massive wiki]] or [[agora]] URL from Obsidian directly.
            - #push [[the brain]]
                - [[vulcan]] is new [[brain]] interface: https://forums.thebrain.com/post/12555295
    - [[flancian]]
        - +1 on markdown on git
            - but it could also be "just a website" that we agree to crawl for notes
                - minimum for that would be: a base URL and a way to inform of the URL scheme that the website is using to serve notes
        - default for me is individual gardens on the one hand and "stoas" or "shared gardens" or just "wikis" as distinct
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]
        - how do you provide context in dense digital gardens/wikis? Without overwhelming users.
        - How to communicate spatial encoding  (e.g. what Jerry does in his Brain), and other conventions.
     - [[Jerry Michalski]] automatic footer surfacing "sister locations", "peers" -- and also how to collaborate in a particular context
     - [[Chris Aldrich]] context graph in the Agora is nice, but:
         - could use more levels (totally)
         - it changes every time, which makes it disconcerting (same in Obsdidian)
         - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] mostly uses the graph to find things that should be linked but aren't
         - [[Jerry]] the brain does time-based and alphabetical sorting of nodes for you
- [[Flancian]] where are your notes? ;)
    - [[rel8]] have it already
    - [[Jerry]] git repos incoming
        - [[brain]] dump
            - maybe later? it's huge
        - [[obsidian]]
            - [[sync]] works nicely
            - [[git]] is preferred
                - [[obsidian git]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] needs to separate public and private notes
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] is doing the same
        - [[markdown on git]]
        - experimenting with this in https://github.com/AramZS/dnd-campaign-site-defectors/blob/main/.husky/pre-commit
        - likes folders
        - trying [[deepdwn]] https://www.deepdwn.com/ for markdown editing and it's built for folders explicitly
        - https://www.dendron.so/
    - [[Bentley Davis]]
        - Mostly uses his physical brain (!)
        - but has some things on Markdown, could work as a pilot.
        - Q: what about including arbitrary html?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] blog / wiki convergence
        - #push [[rel8]]
            - [[rel8 llc]]
            - #push [[multiplayer sensemaking]]
                - https://wiki.rel8.dev/what_multiplayer_sensemaking_needs_now
                - what about a call with Dan?
        
 


## 2023-02-08
- a [[meeting]].
    - #go https://meet.jit.si/fellowship-of-the-link
    - Wednesdays at [[6PM UTC]].
- Attending: [[Peter Kaminski]], [[Jerry Michalski]], [[Bentley Davis]], [[Flancian]], [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] (Late)
- Start recording, we're currently using Jitsi and that works best with a [[Chromium]] based browser.
- Threads from last time we would like to pick up, or new threads:
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] would like to share notes with each other.
        - What does this mean? The lowest common denominator of Markdown on git seems fine to start with.
    - #push [[nostr]]
        - [[Peter Kaminski]] started playing with [[nostr]].
            - Pete's pubkey: npub1peterka3vphw8z8ls7hpl9c9lxh8ww4la36pf97sycdvtantzu8s97x3za
            - Aram's pubkey: 8b9e3e37fb86f7282de4fb526505e2d5748f2cd09e22fbda18f1daa65028e916
            - Read about [[nostr]] vs [[SSB]].
                - Nostr gives everybody permission to speak, but nobody will necessarily listen to you.
            - Still really like it.
            - Warning disclaimer: it's not safe yet.
            - At its heart, it's a way to pass messages between each other through relays.
            - Could we do [[massive wiki]] through [[nostr]]?
                - Massive Wiki is markdown / raw files, but it's also about versioning.
                - It turns out versioning is tricky :)
                - [[git]] solves this locally. People have also implemented many semantic conventions on top of filesystems.
            - Back to Jerry's question: there is a big conceptual leap to 'versions of a file are the same file' from 'versions of the same file are different files'.
            - [[Jerry]] this can be solved with the right UI/metaphors. For example [[fedwiki]] does this in a way that doesn't work for him.
            - [[Flancian]] what does [[nostr]] get us over markdown on git and such?
                - [[Peter]] 'follow a person', [[pki]] infra that is hacky but works.
                - But we need to decide on a versioning strategy.
                - Obvious choices:
                    - git
                    - CRDT or CRDT-ish approaches
                    - [[Pijul]]
                - On "the versioning problem"
                    - The one occassion in which we definitely need to solve the versioning problem is when people are collaborating actively on the same file.
                    - Three aspects?
                        - Storage versioning
                        - UI management of versions/how you surface versions and link to versioned resources
                        - Multiple commit phases in associated workflows.
                - `push` puts what is next on a line (and what is under it in a list?) to be duplicated on that context
                - [[Bentley]] on [[Mathew]]'s post and git, and shortcomings/rough edges in the git experience.
                    - Staging is not needed by most people.
                    - Always pulling latest would be nice.
                - [[Aram]] Nostr has some significant advantages over SSB I think, which is that it is significantly more decentralized and doesn't run into some of the blockchain adjacent stuff that causes ssb problems.
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] on [[Rich Burton]]'s project, https://dxos.org/
        - [[Aram]] [[IPFS]] seems very strong in this space. Same for [[webtorrent]].
            - [[nostr]] is cool conceptually, but it's unclear how it would work for something that is not a messaging process.
            - It's intended to be "slow": You don't need an always on connection to the internet.
        - [[Peter]] on [[syncthing]]
            - Tried it as an alternative to git
            - Syncs really fast actually
            - It let lots of editors feel 'real time'
        - [[Jerry]] on [[vaults]], [[repos]], [[namespaces]]
        - [[Peter]] on messages vs documents
        - [[Jerry]] on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescript_(programming_language) as an example of a protocol designed supporting the "wrong" abstractions at a time in which the document-based web was taking off
    - What's the next step?
        - [[Peter]] let's continue on the [[markdown on git]] path
        - [[Aram]] it seems that what's needed is a predictable 1. path on a site for discovery of content and 2. format.
        - On predictable ways to resolve entities cross-site.
        - [[Peter]] add ".md" to get raw markdown from a massive wiki, e.g., https://massive.wiki/massive_wiki_conceptual_diagram.md
        - Could use [[timegates - https://context.center/topics/memento/ 
 

## 2023-02-01

- Attending: [[Peter Kaminski]] [[Mathew Lowry]] [[Chris Aldrich]] [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] [[Bentley Davis]] [[Mathew Lowry]] [[Bill Anderson]]
- Start recording, we're currently using Jitsi and that works best with a [[Chromium]] based browser.
- Checkins / intros
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] lead privacy engineer for the [[washington post]], do lots of things with statically generated websites. Worked in academia on archiving as well.
    - [[Bentley Davis]] software developer for 30y+, here helping out Jerry with his brain. Working on decision making and debate software. [[Open Global Mind]] is working on a [[sense doing]] making session.

    - [[Cal Waytena]] Student (sculpture and something else). Doing an independent master on [[futurology]].
    - [[Bill Anderson]] Retired. Studied chemistry, worked as computer programmer in Xerox and Cornell. Did user centric design development (PARC). Worked on co-data (sp?) in the Balkan countries. Have known Jerry for a long time. Interested in [[Massive Wiki]] and how to integrate information in general. Strong opinions but happy to see them challenged! Trying to *unlearn* some things.
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] ([[Peter Sellers]] reference: [Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5og5Srnzp4)) recovering biomedical and electrical engineer who plays around in the sensemaking and thinking space. Independent researcher; in Indieweb. Not a lot he's not interested in :)
    - [[Flancian]] (Eduardo) - integrating information across walled gardens; [[Agora]], as much as we can with simple tools; writes fiction.
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] Based in Brussels, into online communities and knowledge management. Interested in decentralized collective intelligence.
    - [[Peter Kaminski]] help people work together with IT tools and human process. Entrepreneur and independent consultant. [[Massive Wiki]] is one of his main projects, which has a lot of similarities with [[Agora]] (compatible approaches!). Working on a [[Massive Wiki]] for the [[tools for thought space]].
- Bring in any #pushed threads from above?
- [[Flancian]] Our plans for the year.
    - Common projects.
    - Maybe let's think about a few things we would like to do together this year, add them to the agenda or to some note in your digital garden and let's discuss next time?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] would like to generalize the archiving tool / link card generator he's been working on.
        - This takes a line in e.g. a Markdown file with a link; this retrieves that link and archives a simple text version locally. Attempts to archive on archive.org. Generates a [[social card]] that is currently usually generated using a third party API.
        - https://fed.brid.gy/ 
        - Could be a good complement to both [[massive wiki]] and [[agora]] as they're both strongly markdown based.
        - #pk certainly interested :)
        - #ml too, for myhub.ai, which is all about collecting and sharing cards
        - [[flancian]] +1
        - #pk it'd be nice to have a link that is at least "bimodal" -- the target could be local or archive.org
        - Example: https://context.center/topics/indie-search/
        - #pk [[factr]] seems related - https://factr.com/
    - [[Flancian]] would like to discuss [[Interwiki]] links and the [[common hub]] approach
        - #pk [[free jerry's brain]] conversation yesterday 
            - [[marc-antoine parent]] has [[hyperknowledge]] and thinks we need to add a few things to have true interop between tools
                - [[concept broker]]
                - [[nesting]], which means that you need a recursive scheme
                    - [[markdown]] is bad at this
                    - [[maparent]] likes off-band, like [[atjson]]
        - on [[sharing hub]] approach
            - #ca [[sister sites]] - http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/SisterSites
                - possible approach: search service / entity resolution extension that lets you search in a number of 'resolution roots'

There's also a move to do deep links into applications that are non-web based recently: 
https://linkingmanifesto.org/

Aram Zucker-Scharff says:
I am sort of split on deep links b/c I dislike apps conceptually but I'll check that out 

Flancian (paramita) says:
I need to drop as my guest has arrived, but I will watch the recording 😃 thank you all! have a great one 😃

## 2023-01-18
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[Bentley Davis]], [[Peter Kaminski]], [[Flancian]], [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]. If Jitsi will behave, [[Chris Aldrich]] will join in a minute or two...
- Planning for the year
    - Individually and as a fellowship? :)
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev/bigger_goals
        - Trying to be more 'action oriented'
        - Flancian interested in particular:
            - [[shared note taking]]
            - [[pattern languages]]
                - pattern languages vs. lists of patterns
                - [[pattern language workshop]] during the pandemic
            - Instrumenting patterns: some patterns are more amenable to turning into code
                - 1, 2, 4, all [[zoom app]]
                - meta facilitation app
            - [[wikilinks]] and [[hashtags]] as patterns
                - and their advanced used (conventions)
            - [[pattern candidate ideas]]
                - [[aram zucker]] this is the perfect use for a wiki
    - [[Peter Kaminski]]
        - [[John Abbe]] and I are working on "[[SuperLiminal]]", a public wiki
            - started as a [[massive wiki]], coming into focus
            - it's about: [[pattern languages]], [[quality without a name]] ~ [[QWAN]], [[systems thinking]]
                - see <https://codeberg.org/Massive-Wiki/SuperLiminal/src/branch/main/Discussing%20SuperLiminal%2C%202023-01-17.md>
            - open concerns:
                - hard to adopt massivewiki, hard to onboard to it
                - it implies onboarding onto git
                - massive wiki is [[tool agnostic]] but in practice everybody is using [[obsidian]]
                    - one of the things with obsidian is that it's getting more complex and less user friendly as it grows and adds more features
                - Peter's dream system: [[opal]]. simpler and has git built in.
                    - https://developer.massive.wiki/opal
            - interesting idea for [[massive wiki]]
                - original acronym [[MaSVF]] (Markdown, shared, versioned, files)
                - [[Massive Human Intelligence Project]] (2021 as MaSVF Wiki, Markdown Shared Versioned Files, “Massive”) 
                - federation as markdown attachments in email
            - [[the return of email]]
                - email attachments as a lightweight federation medium
                - node@anagora.org
                - #pk email-in to Obsidian?
                    - [x] [IFTTT and OneDrive, Patrick Berry](
                    https://patrickberry.medium.com/email-notes-to-obsidian-8fba96a7d35b) (Medium)

            - [[git]] conflicts
                - on potentially automatically resolving wiki edits
                    - maybe outliner mode makes this easier
                - [[obsidian git]]
                    - keeps improving
                    - #pk atom/pulsar is picked up by non-technical users sometimes though
                    - [[pulsar]] https://pulsar-edit.dev/
            - Flancian: [[mastosearch]] as it relates to discovery of git repository / integration of the [[knowledge commons]]
                - (...)
                - Potential for a bad actor to move first and enclose the commons.
                - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] maybe fragmenting search is the best bet -- e.g. make it easier for people to provision and use search tools
                    - https://context.center/topics/indie-search/
                - Should we worry about the [[enclosure problem]]?
                    - [[Peter Kaminski]]: I worry about enclosures but not about the enclosure problem in general?
                        - In the beginning we didn't have centralized search engines. People chose them out of convenience.
                        - If you're careful enough and say "last time we tried this it didn't work out" maybe it's enough.
                    - You can have the same content in many massive wikis. There is no authoritative versions, etc. So maybe [[massive wiki is enclosure proof]].
                        - Flancian +1 althought the question may be about the size of the backing commons. People may choose enclosure-friendly tools due to their convenience again.
                        - Aram: we need Federation.
                        - #jm [[kosmik]] [[fedwiki]]
                        - #pk https://murmurations.network/
                        - [[chris aldrich]] "The Read Write Web is no longer sufficient. I want the Read Fork Write Merge Web." - [Tantek](https://indieweb.org/2011/Smallest_Federated_Wiki#Inspiration) 
                 - [[jerry michalski]] [[kosmik]] can be described as a distributed filesystem (or is built upon one)
                     - too promiscuous forking as in [[fedwiki]] is confusing
                 - Aram: need to democratize the way we maintain and share search indexes.
                     - Probably also need a way to distinguish 'I am linking to this page' from 'I am giving authority to this page'.
                     - schema.org has a property 'is based on'
                 - [[Peter Kaminski]] [[maparent]] has [[hyperknowledge]] which has similar characteristics
                 - Flancian: client-based [[disintermediation]] as a complementary approach.
                 - Aram: role distribution as we see in wikis? Tools for communities of knowledge.
                 - #pk: xtension values for the rel="" attribute in HTML5: https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions
                 - #ca Or user ability to search a variety of areas based on what they know or trust, so something along the lines of allowing the user to choose their search like https://github.com/CanisLupus/swift-selection-search does 
                 - #ca [[indieweb wiki]]: a community maintaining a wiki and a newsletter coming out each week
                 - #pk [[VoteLinks]]: https://microformats.org/wiki/vote-links

            - Experience of a (academic, see [link](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/my-trip-to-poland/)) in Poland. Poland has a really large problem right now with fascism. Part of it has to do with how they have pushed all responsibility about WWII to Germany.

    - #pk ogm as a group is getting lots done, just not strictly within that banner
    - #jm open question: how many OGMs are there?
    - #jm using social tools to make sense of our shared projects instead of individual tools
    - #pk [[kaffeeklatsch]]
- [[chris aldrich]] in his experience with communities, the best model seen is to throw email overboard -- and to use a public [[wiki]] that is easy to edit combined with a [[chat]] that is searchable.
    - #jm proposal:
      - [[mattermost]] for chat -- [[sense doing]]
      - [[massive wiki]] for wiki

    - [[sense doing]] #jm name/focus?
        - #jm relationship with [[tools for thinking]] podcast
        - #jm [[covid response]] is a possible case study: what would the ideal national response look like?
        - #jm but [[tools for thinking]] history might be a better first study case, less politically charged

    - and email is difficult to archive well 
    - caveat 1: someone needs to maintain it all... 
    - The IndieWeb has an interactive bot that does help to capture from chat into the wiki, but that requires some programming lift to get done. 
    - France vs. Morocco, FIFA World Cup 2022™

### Thinking Tools Map Project

- website now published, <https://tftmap.massive.wiki/>
  - \o/
  - exciting progress on massive wiki -- Peter presents
      - hacked massive wiki theme to have a notice bar :)
      - had to get involved with some [[css frameworks]]
      - turns out that many sites seem fine with the menu scrolling with the content, having no fixed navbar, etc.
      - bentley: can offer CSS help, has experience
  - (airtable review)
  - #push [[massive wiki wednesday]]
      - https://hackmd.io/95GfL68PRsSc7wieGMgdAQ (temp location only)
      - moving from github to maybe [[codeberg]]
  - hoping to have Phase 0 done next week some time
  - [[permanent versions]]
      - a wiki is supposed to be changing all the time -- so giving a link to a page has always felt slightly weird to Peter, as the target will have changed by the time the recipient clicks on it
      - how to version?
          - point in time / commit, offer a link to HEAD?
          - approach:
              - sha256 / hashing based approach / content based addressing
              - of an html snapshot
                  - flancian: this might introduce dependencies on particular rendering engines
          - comparison vs ipfs actual content based addressing
              - (...)
      - on [[codeberg]] forking [[gitea]]
      - thoughts on [[chat gpt]]
          - 'automatic explanations' for change management/changes in a wiki
      - three word (or whatever) navigation to a particular git hash (sort of like the interface presented by [what3words](https://what3words.com/))
      - making git history more easily navigable by non-technical / non-Git experts
      - date-anchored vs content-anchored
          - interwiki links
  - #push [[gordon brander]] and [[subconscious]]
      - [[jerry michalski]] talked with him on Monday
      - [[noosphere]] would love to have at least a subset of Jerry's brain \o/
  - #push [[paul rony]] -- the founder of [[kosmik]] (sp?)
      - [[french]]
      - loves computer history
      - a podcast / community / etc. to talk about:
          - early visionaries (e.g. [[vannevar bush]])
          - how does that bridge into new tools and visions
- [[flancian]]
    - https://fotl.agor.ai
    - [[agora bridge]] approach / trying to reuse at least importing steps
    - [[jerry michalski]] -- take [[visions]] https://bra.in/2pxbo6 as a starting point, do nth degree crawling
    - [[peter kaminski]] 
        - [[meme brane]]
            - https://memebrane.conversence.com
        - [[jerry's brain]] in a postgresql database, where each node is a row
            - note that Jerry doesn't use node titles 
        - the above already don't map 1:1/well to [[massive wiki]] data structures
        - we're all representing information but that information has different shapes
        - lossy translations can be very lossy
     - [[flancian]]
         - (something optimist)
     - [[jerry michalski]]
         - most of his brain would usually end up looking like small markdown files with a link
         - [[peter kaminski]] relatively easy to move data brain -> massive wiki, but it's not obvious how to go the other way
     - https://mcbrain.netlify.app/brainish/jerry/32f9fc36-6963-9ee0-9b44-a89112919e29

    - [[chris aldrich]]

            - [[mathew lowry]] there was also a lack of alignment in perspectives.
            - [[chris aldrich]] terms were severe enough that it sounded like authors needed to pay them (for further editions?)

    - [[chris aldrich]] [[openness]] axis seems too dense
        - we should also assume that developers will tackle the low hanging fruit / perform minimum effort to tick a box if that's within reach :)
        - [[mathew lowry]] is keen on keeping the number of dimensions low-ish, 6-8 dimensions

        - [[chris aldrich]] no algorithmic feed, fewer features -- as a feature :)
        - instances are more like twitter lists, at a similar level
        - [[mastodon]] vs the rest of the [[fediverse]], e.g. [[lemmy]] / [[pleroma]]
    - [[bluesky]]
        - associated with [[twitter]], but
        - [[pfrazee]]
    - #jm is there something better than ActivityPub/Mastodon for people that want a replacement?
        - [[flancian]] don't know anything promising currently that is not ActivityPub based
        - [[pleroma]] [[lemmy]] [[misskey]] are all built on top of ActivityPub too
     - [[advertising]] as an option to individuals funding instances as hobby projects
     - [[coops]] as another option
         - #azs [[data coops]]
     - #jm book about quakers / morals and [[travelling brothers]]
         - history of [[guilds]]
         - industrial revolution starts to hit, early capitalists realize they need to undermine the guild system
             - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4467218-travelling-brothers?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=wM2PoCC5zD&rank=12
         - [[apprentice]] -> [[yeomen]] -> [[master]]
         - [[masterpiece]] is what the [[yeomen]] had to build to become a master
         - "advertising is the colonizing force of capitalism in internet spaces"
         - [[mutual aid]] societies yielded technologies like [[insurance]]
         - it feels like we're trying to find our way back to some of these concepts
     - #azs book on modern unions
         - you can't get to the revolution until people feel safe
         - Ah i was thinking of [[Fight Like Hell]] by Kim Kelly 
 ## 2022-10-26
- Attending: [[peter kaminski]] [[chris aldrich]] [[flancian]] [[bentley davis]] [[maparent]] [[samuel klein]]
- Second call on [[Wednesday]].
- Recording in Jitsi only works in Chromium.
    - No firefox, no safari for now.
    - Worth filing a bug.
- Last time recap
    - Integration of tools for thought
    - Hyperknowledge and Agora
    - Debate tools and quality of discourse as they relate to the political scene
- Check ins
    - [[maparent]]
        - Discussed a lot of common issues in [[free jerry's brain]] meeting on Monday.
        - In there we spoke about [[hyperknowledge]] and [[next actions]] as well.
        - Among other things, made a plea for [[concept glue]] between systems.
            - Deep links, deep addressability aspects seem key.
            - Making cross linking easy.
        - Bentley brought up: we could achieve a better understanding by trying some use cases and seeing which kind of maps do we want to build off real data.
            - [[flancian]] we had a pending AI from a previous meeting that 
        - [[frame views]] URLs for concepts and for frames centered around that thing
            - [[flancian]] sounds similar to [[nodes]]
            - [[chris aldrich]] lots of note taking tools are text based, and backing databases are non public / don't have URLs
                - #map deep linking and addressability is indeed about having a URL for each block even in those scenarios
                - [[web annotations]] use ranges, we could have the same for markdown
                - "xpath for markdown"
                    - +1
                    - web annotation targets for markdown
                - [[flancian]] what about wikilinks as anchors within notes?
                    - #map semantic ambiguity
                        - #flancian Not sure
                    - #map doesn't work in the general case as it's only controlled by the writer
                        - #flancian: fair
                        - #maparent look at at-json
                - 'this thing in this document at this time' -- [[memento protocol]] for example
                    - "memento protocol over massive wiki"
                    - could map to a git commit in the case of git backed repositories
                    - [[chris aldrich]] could be resolved via internet archive for the web in the general case when that is available
                    - [[maparent]] Actually used by web archive. See http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/about/
                - [[meta]] how do we track of 'interesting threads' like that above?
                    - [[peter kaminski]] what about a shared page?
                    - -> AI: create a document/repository location and designate it as first version of this :)
    - [[Peter Kaminski]]
            - [[Thinking Tools Map Project]] update
                - [[mathew lowry]] did a fair amount of work
                - some of our project work got out of sync but it's being merged
                - realization: we had not set up a way to do collaboration beforehand, both platform and convention level
                - -> [[massive wiki channel]] in [[ogm mattermost]]
                    - <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki>
                    - <https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/nshenqwxxj8mbq1rptiddut96r>
                - collaborating over chat is relatively hard, threading is only basic
                - [[github issues]] and branches
                    - maybe a document workflow with comments would be lighterweight?
                    - Note: issues in git (vs github) with [GitBug](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug)
            - Looked again at Markdown parsers (particularly those that can create ASTs, because that's a sign of development organization and quality)
                - [remark](https://unifiedjs.com/explore/project/remarkjs/remark/) + [micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) (JavaScript)
                - [mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe) (Python)
                    - [[flancian]] the Agora (Python) currently uses [[marko]], but mistletoe looks superior at first glance
                    - [[markdoc]] is an extended [[markdown]] syntax created/used by [[stripe]]
            - [[schema]]
                - [[people]] [[tools]] [[techniques]]
                - #map [[goals]] maybe as a separate category, or [[intent]]
                - maybe also [[audience]]
                - -> AI: add to threaded document.
            - Wishing there were typed links in Markdown
                - [[flancian]] in the Agora, links are typed/annotated by the preceding one (or tag)
                - @scalingsynthesis uses prefixes: https://anagora.org/@scalingsynthesis
                - [[chris aldrich]] [[microformats]] could be part of a link
                - #map [[yaml]] blocks could go anywhere?
                    - [[supertag]] syntax is growing on him
                    - see Gyuri's work on Trailmarks
        - [[sj]] - I think a good 80% solution for reconciling different types into a single namespace is to support [[TOPIC (qualifier)]], have it rendered while reading as just TOPIC, and have the link to [[TOPIC (qualifier)]] redirect to any of: "TOPIC", TOPIC (qualifier)", "TOPIC#qualifier" etc. which authority file can be updated by any editor of the markdown network (and may change as people take time to fill out nodes for increasingly specific variations on the topic).  
            - very similar to what i came to
    - [[flancian]] have been meaning to collect a list of repositories which we would like integrate into a shared construct (agora wink wink) -- do you have any?
        - [[peter kaminski]] massive wiki is agnostic w.r.t. versioning and sharing models (or tries to be)
            - for git, [[massive wiki]] can have submodules
            - [[massive wiki builder]] will build
        - do you have note repositories of your own, personal or otherwise?
            - [[peter kaminski]] have one but not currently shareable :)
            - AI: suggest we keep discussing this in future instances
                - [[sister sites]], sister pages
                - twin pages
                - interwiki
                - web rings :)
                - wiki [[collaboration primitives]]
                - Instant wikilinks / cascading wikisheets: implicit interwiki resolution (a la https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/InstantCommons) :: make the local .cws legible so you can see the order in which your current interface looks for matching nodes in choosing the default interwiki 
                    - try variation that chooses cascade order based on length/quality of target node
                    - try interface variation that shows top N options in asymmetric list/pie
                - [[fedwiki]] is brilliant but the feeling of the room is that we don't fully understand it
                    - is there people building any kind of business providing fedwiki widely/easily?
                    - https://byname.wiki.conversence.com
                - sj: update vocab to distinguish meki from wiki 
      - #map [[coauthor]] https://coauthor.conversence.com
    - Q: [[sj]] how to capture third-party cross-wiki page-name-maps?   e.g. say we read together a dozen sources, which are not generally world editable, and are building (in a shared space) interwiki links + merge requests across the set of pages in those sources.
        - [[maparent]] this is what I meant by "glue" earlier, it's a core [[HyperKnowledge]] goal
- AIs
    - AI: start a [[tracking document]] for tracking pending interesting threads
        - done -> [[fotl threads]]
    - AI: Then let's do a pass collecting all useful links we already have in this node and in [[fotl]] and move them to [[fotl threads]].
    - AI: Let's move communications over chat for the above projects to the [[fellowship of the link]] channel by default, or share links there to other sources of truth.
    - AI: let's discuss wiki [[collaboration primitives]] and the potential of integrating independent note taking repositories/wikis a la massive wiki / agora
    - AI: add schema section to [[fotl threads]]
    - AI: upload recording to some well known location :)
        - [[bentley]] suggest putting the raw file in drive first

        - we want:
            - [[deep hyperlinks]]
            - deep [[anchoring]] (new, a la [[web annotations]])
            - many to many relationships between anchors and entities
        - [[flancian]] we probably want this second level map for projects that are trying to work on interlinking

            - supple many:many relationships between anchor text and meaning
        - [[agora]]
            - [[interlinking]]

        - [[maparent]] focusing on the differences:
            - [[deep backlinks]]
        - any single idea will be in millions of contexts, how to keep the graph "readable" 
        - attribution/degree of belief
            - surface surprising beliefs, beliefs that could be questioned
        - [[jerry michalski]] deck of patterns for cognitive biases
            - swipe right / swipe left? :)
        - [[jerry michalski]] real world example
            - half of the republicans running now *say* that the election was stolen
            - should this ideally disqualify them? 
            - #map ~ [[maparent]] we want to qualify belief by track record, e.g. the work of [[superforecasters]]
            - distinguish empty claims from testable claims
        - what's the minimum set of coordinated actions we could take to maximize the chances this great crowdsourcing effort happens?
            - hashtags/wikilinks as one way to coordinate -- but might not be enough?
            - [[chris aldrich]] the [[instagram problem]]
            - [[flancian]] the Agora tries to make it so that the community can cross-link oportunistically/share entities and auto link
            - [[maparent]] worried about ambiguity still regardless of whether they are autogenerated or human generated
        - [[chris aldrich]] on the recent controversy in US politics with racially charged comments by politicians
            - #map [[dao]] and [[smart contracts]] -- enforced accountability

        - #map working on a plan and a prototype for [[hyperknowledge]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] how to push actors towards more precise speech (to counteract Trump's style of not saying anything but convincing some people he is aligned with them, even in the centre left initially)
        - two kinds of self organization:
            - self organization around a shared goal in a self-selected group
            - coordinated action in a very large scale

                        - (Looks like the publisher is https://exapt.press)
                        - Chris is likely dropping out
                    - #jm if you were to create a version of this book that was more interesting, what would it look like?

      - "why do you believe this"
      - [[stacey]] flexibility: it's important to not have to attach something in precisely the right point

### Videos

### Notes
- Introductions!
- [[jerry michalski]] ~ #jm
    - on previous calls
    - on sometimes having overlap in different dimensions but not having shared clarity/understanding
    - sharing clarity vs rambling
    - happens even at the organizational level when you're trying to set up a mission statement
        - [[motherhood statements]] ~ "we believe in X", "we believe in Y" -- but we're usually looking for nuggets of novelty
    - [[numenta]]
        - would like to jump into a "digested format"
        - [[prediction framework]]
            - as [[society of mind]]
- #push [[Gene]] and [[Jerry Michalski]] go way back
    - [[system thinker]] -> [[storyteller]]
    - #go https://bra.in/8vGe9q
    - married and divorced [[the brain]] multiple times
    - uses [[napkin]]
    - [[richard maxis]] ~ [[richard macksey]], former Johns Hopkins University professor with a large personal library
    - #push [[richard macksey]]
        - [[library background]]
        - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/34f84a89-4bc2-46f5-ac9b-b3ba8e8bff11/notes
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rvXUHI331k
        - [[umberto eco]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czc_KjWji8E
        - [[library tours]]
- Spider chart example
    - reusable ethical services might be a competitive advantage of tools in the [[commons]]
    - commercial tools seem to have an advantage in the current market -- they get the backing of the market "leads" (VC, etc.) which lets them out-compete freer options
        - uber is not a [[fair marketplace]], yet it outcompeted more ethical alternatives
        - on the [[hypocrisy]] of "fake markets" -- platforms that behave like markets but are controlled by a single entity
            - #push [[fake markets]]
                - https://bra.in/8vBe4W
    - [[chris aldrich]] ~ #ca if we did [[spider graphs]], how do you select axis to focus on?
        - how do we present this information in a way that prioritizes the ethical aspect, and perhaps helps tool developers prioritize lacking dimensions?
        - #jm selecting dimensions in different contexts
        - #jm finding which tools are missing, which tools are complementary
            - "which tools play well with each other"
        - #ca another thing which is important to people in this space: even though [[obsidian]] is not open source, people find it easy to develop against it and it's got open source extensions
            - so it seems unlikely they will turn into a new Twitter
            - but even in that case it seems you could move to other players which are more open
    - [[bentley]] implemented [[filtering]] in [[spider graphs]] (demo)
    - #jm what is [[indieweb]]'s perspective on convincing people to build openly?
        - #ca #push [[indieweb]] they have built a structure on a two prong idea:
            - you own your own domain name
                - [[flancian]] ~ #f what about weakening this into "you own some URL space"
                - #ca it's possible, but at the end of the day you want to own what a URL resolves to
                - the ecosystem is developing in the direction of letting you redirect between domains
            - you have control over your data
            - #jm what about separating data from apps, e.g. storing on github?
                - as in, you map any new tool to the same existent dataset
                - #ca you can point tools in [[indieweb]] to repositories of data
                - #ca #push [[micropub]] is a spec; a "data plug board" that allows people to easily write apps that publish events to different consumers
                    - #go https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/
                    - a post goes first to your website
                    - then the website has the know how on how to publish to feeds
                    - [[bookmark service]] is the [[hello world]] here
                - [[medium]] could rewrite its backend to support [[micropub]] and it would let you cross post to many other sites
                - #f how does this interact with [[activitypub]]?
                    - #ca it fits in this model but it's a steeper learning curve
                    - in most of the AP space, if you don't interop with [[mastodon]], you don't exist
                    - lots of tools target [[mastodon]] as it supports some core things well
                - [[aram zucker]]
                    - guide to [[activitypub]]: https://tinysubversions.com/notes/reading-activitypub/
                - #push [[fotl agenda]] 
                    - the field of [[x clone]] in the [[fediverse]]
                    - no single AP client that supports all features
                    - [[lemmy]] as an interesting example of new platform built on [[activitypub]]
                    - [[goodreads]] functionality
                        - #ca https://indieweb.org/personal_library#Silo_Examples
    - back to meta level here?
        - on mapping of the fediverse, of tools?
        - or [[spider charts]]
            - #f [[go/t4t radar]] points to the chart (- and + also work for spaces)
                - which categories do we want here?
                - linking articles to support scores/opinions
                - #f [[assertion feeds]]
                - #jm spreadsheet is easily embeddable to begin with
                - #ml publishing markdown/resources to repositories and sharing that
            - #f [[gardens]] and [[feeds]]? :)
            - #ml can we add domains/repositories to what is searching?
                - #f yes
            - [[aram zucker-scharff]] ~ [[az]]
            - #jm [[noosphere]]
            - #ca most of the big commercial offerings allow people to store data on [[dropbox]] or [[google drive]]
                - [[agora]] could enable people to move from [[dropbox]] to [[git]] based workflows
                - micropub spec ostensibly could be used for moving from platform [[x]] to platform [[y]]

    - done!

### Notes
- [[jerry michalski]]
    - [[render]] ~ [[tools for thinking]]
- [[flancian]]
    - great introduction
    - great conversation with [[howard rheingold]]
    - amazing announcement by [[gordon brander]]: [[noosphere]]
        - it is [[an agora]], done very well!
- [[jerry michalski]] welcomes [[dan whaley]]!
  - [[dan whaley]]
      - Fridays are much better meeting wise!
      - very busy but 
      - [[14 million dollars]] investment from [[ithaka]] and [[jstor]] https://web.hypothes.is/blog/say-hello-to-anno/
  - how does this interact with the global [[knowledge commons]]?
      - [[annotations]] -> the knowledge is in the annotation you take
      - but the annotation is layered on preexisting on knowledge
      - it's about protocols and things but also about seeding [[communities]]
  - [[hypothesis]] cares about the user having access to the underlying knowledge
      - regardless of whether it's because it's free or they happen to have (exclusive?) access
      - this knowledge could be resolved in a federated network
          - clients using open protocols like [[web annotations]] can participate in this network
      - [[flancian]] how does this relate to [[markets]]?
          - and the fairness of said markets.
          - IMHO [[commons]] should [[embed]] markets
          - [[dan whaley]] the knowledge is what's "out there" right now, we try to pass no judgment and support the existing models
              - most universities have access to [[json]], but most others don't
              - the [[nyt]] is not free
                  - > paywalls
              - some content might always be gated
              - the world may be moving towards [[free access]] but that will happen on its own terms?
              - [[hypothesis]] thinks there's a sustainable path for them; charging for institutional usage maybe but making the conversation available to everybody
                  - not doing ads
                      - -> [[reality distortion matrix]]
                      - silos trying to [[monetize attention]]
                  - constructive ways of funding
                  - open [[saas]]
       - [[mathew lowry]] have you watched [[render]] / [[tools for thinking]]
           - [[dan whaley]] not yet!
           - [[mathew lowry]] interesting ai potential exploration
           - what are your thoughts on integrating AI with hypothesis?
               - "here is what your friends think about X in the web" vs "here is what an AI thinks about X in the web"
               - [[dan whaley]]
                   - AI is super interesting as created by humans for humans
                   - a force for good to help us navigate the world more powerfully
                   - but of course there are negative use cases, so we need to set the right incentives
               - [[flancian]]
                   - may not there be a difference in the long term? :)
               - in terms of influencing AI
                   - (... saw something in chat :))
               - mathew: valuable content layered on top of layered content.
                   - -> sentiment analysis and meta sentiment analysis
                   - people benefiting from the AI they train instead of the current status quo
               - [[dan whaley]] very privileged to have access to this data, and to steer a new paradigm
                   - find revenues that can sustain this while being pro social is critical
                   - only will explore what will be beneficial
               - [[jerry michalski]]
                   - [[douglas tomkins]] (sp?) and [[x]] from [[patagonia]]
                   - building land tracts and are trying to turn it into a trust
                       - (!)
                   - is there one ambitious funding project that could be explored for maximum benefit here?
                   - could we fund the [[idea commons]] on some large, ambitious scale?
                       - [[flancian]] using the commons, regulating markets, to disrupt the market for public good
                   - [[dan whaley]] what is the change we want to make?
                       - you could imagine all kinds of things
                           - one idea: how could you incentivize people to make annotations professionally?
                           - meaning high quality "trailblazers"
                           - proposed legislation
                           - pre annotating bills!
                           - what would it take to be able to fund this
                       - concept of [[reddit gold]]
                           - chip in to providing high quality contributions?
                       - fixing the [[newspaper subcription model]]
                           - you put 10 bucks in, it goes to the authors of the things you read
                           - [[jerry michalski]] reinventing [[xanadu]] in a way
                       - [[jerry michalski]]

                           - [[dan whaley]] it's a flow
                           - like mycellian nutrients
                           - [[flancian]] meta on the metaphor
                           - [[chris aldrich]] [[redwood trees]] network roots to be able to stand up taller
                               - for most trees, they tend to be mirror images
                               - not so redwoods
                       - [[data trust]]
                         - [[chris aldrich]] how to get good quality data in general  
                             - [[twitter]] is already a great repository of annotations in a sense, but you have to sift through a lot more stuff to go to the gems
                             - [[jerry michalski]] [[nugget ratio]] is very high if you curate your follows
                             - [[flancian]] -> the [[social network]] is what encodes the most information
                                 - the importance of [[open ranking]], [[open filtering]], [[open algorithms]] -> [[open ais]]
                             - [[jerry michalski]] why are [[tools for conversation]] not [[tools for thinking]]?
                                 - the lack of good permalinks in interesting answers in random forums
                                     - walled gardens
                                 - one of the nice things about hypothes.is is that it's got a great signal to noise ratio and you can easily link to full contexts

                             - [[mathew lowry]] [[myhub]] is part of [[indieweb]]

                             - [[flancian]] hypothes.is integrations with [[feeds]]? it already provides feeds, how important they seem to you
                                 - [[dan whaley]] we provide feeds but are not currently looking at providing more
                                 - focusing on providing arbitrary annotation for arbitrary web resources
                             - [[chris aldrich]] how do you also not aggregate streams only, but how do you turn those feeds into something feedin a [[garden]]

### Notes
Jerry's brain for this session: https://bra.in/6p63ZP

- [[betaworks]] conference: https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking
- [[Mathew Lowry]]
    - WordPress plugin to syndicate news orgs from multiple sites of different languages 
    - Would be useful to give publishers more to cite and a better understanding  
    - A type of shared memory 
    - Hard to get journalists to adopt the tool
    - A bunch of different organizations sharing the tools for mutral benifit. 
    - From Mattermost - https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/gbonf7z177yquffqz59mu8uino :
        - The basic idea was to create CMS plug-ins for newsrooms which would allow journalists in different participating newsrooms to access each other's content, both published and otherwise (ie, drafts, notes, etc.), via their CMS. The  participating newsrooms essentially become a sort of decentralised press agency. This is particularly interesting in Europe, where every newsroom cannot have a journalist in every country. Hence the system would incorporate machine translation, autocategorisation and autosummary. Obviously, every time newsroom A used newsroom B's content - ie A translated and republished B's article into their own language for their own audience - newsroom B would earn credit. And every time B used A's, they would spend that credit.
        - This is a very specific use case, with a business model, for decentralised sharing. And the social benefit is real, because it would set up a decentralised alternative to the big press agencies and allow stories which they will never pick up to travel across borders and find new audiences.

- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - https://restofworld.org/ 
    - Old version of [[Zemanta]]
        - A blog post "enhanced" by Zemanta https://hacktext.com/2011/02/what-is-a-text-and-how-do-i-hack-it-521/ 
        - https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781849511407/graphics/1407_02_15.jpg

    - https://www.distributedmedialab.com/publishers 
- Potential space for this [[WordCamp for Publishers]] https://twitter.com/wcpublishers/
    - Great event, highly recommend! - Aram
- There's the https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/ that is really great. 
- Chris
    - The NYT has a digital archive team of about 3
    - Photos are not fully backed up there
    - 2 decades of working on the problem and not everything is backed up. 
- Mathew
    - The European Commission relies on the Internet Archive for websites they no longer wish to maintain. 
- Jerry
    - YouTube has its own storage problems stuff is not well archived. It is remarkable that they even capture what they can. 
    - The future digital anthropoligsts what will they find?
- Aram
    - Archiving should be something anyone can do and have on their own site 
    - Just like [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) there should also be link once and archive yourself 
    - These systems should be able to talk to each other and share and replicate their resources
- Jerry
    - How does this survive though? My hard drives don't survive me 
- Chris
    - We have this problem with music - we saw how a lot of that music got lost.
    - Tip of the iceburg - so much history is lost 
    - music notation didn't exist in printed forms until about 11th century
- Jerry
    - In Small Things Forgotten 
    - Gravestones are very useful for history. Also potery. 
    - Tiny differences in gravestones over time are fashion trends that are time indicators. 
- Aram
    - I think in terms of preservation we can look at Activity Pub. When you federate with another server it pulls and replicates and distrubutes stuff. It would be great if we could get that done with archives. 
    - Open sourcing is good as well
- Mathew 
    - If you link to something you automatically make a backup is a good idea
    - What does this have to do with content sharing? 
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage
        - http://open-content.net/caw
        - One peice of content can be shared out replicated and shares an address across many locations.
- Smallest Federated Wiki 
- IPFS but pinning is an issue. 
- Collective intellegence - what that means for spread and maintenance 
- Songlines Are the Original Blockchain - https://bra.in/5jQYgm
- Jerry
    - A lot of ways of remembering were intentionally destroyed by colonization 
    - [[Songlines]] are an example of that
    - but it turns out that these ways of handling it are important.
    - Local populations carefully crafting things and being overwritten by colonization. 
- The Biggest Estate on Earth: How the Aborigines Made Australia (2011) 
- Chris
    - [[David Christian]] on [[collective intelligence]]: The beginning of collective knowledge and intellegence as the marker for the beginning of human history. 
-  Jerry
    - Christian talked about how there are not hooks in the work to be able to pull his data out of his finished thesis. 
    - Humans are really good at killing themselves off and then passed down the ways they learned not to. 
- How practices spread and disceminate? 
- We overvalue the written world - Jerry. 
- Mathew
    - An overvalue of memorization 
    - Greeks overvalued it and that was the end point of oral learning. 
- What does a non-literary method look like here? 
- Aram:
    - [Queens Memory](https://queensmemory.org/) - Podcasts as a method of oral history 
    - Memes and emoji as inconographic languages 
- Jerry
    - There are others as well like NPR's project here that do podcasts for oral histories 
    - [[The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image]] (1998) 
- Aram
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis
- Chris
    - Interesting project to 'write' coreography in a way that isn't the standard way of transmitting coreography
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_notation
    - Different ways to lay out colors an images to annotate video - how could you have a recorded record that could be used to recreate a movie from the notes. 
- Graphic facilitators 
- Mathew
    - volcano model for desktop information - starts in the center and slowly flows towards the sides until it falls off the desktop. 
- Aram
    - Reminds me of 3d desktops
        - ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_43742f2c6167180e0f75a72217f54e4e.png)
- Jerry
    - [[Songlines]] on the desktop 
    - Grapiphic facilitation at conferences 
    - Point back at stuff that was written on the wall from a previous day. 
    - What would The Brain look like as the file system for an operating system. 
    - synecure
- Aram
    - Archiving as a regular personal practice 
- Chris
    - References of people who value their knowledge so they protect against it being lost to history. 
        - These bound books over here with all my notes take them out of the house 
- Jerry
    - Tools for thinking - https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/4bfe6526-9884-4b6d-9548-23659da7811e/ 
- https://scalingsynthesis.com/
- Scaling Synthesis - Multiplayer TFT https://lu.ma/9a21amd7 from 2022-08-09 video should be available shortly from [[Boris Mann]] et al.
- Should we write a database of these things or should we poll people and publish interviews? What tools do people recommend?
    - Good example: https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book 
    - Would be good to hear from people: 
        - I have this practice 
        - this  is how I use it 
        - this is what it looks like 
        - and this is how I turn it into outputs? 
    - Looking at how people use their information graphs and how they visualize information 
    - It would be really valuable to me to know if I want a good graph this is what it looks like 
    - Why isn't there more documentation of these tools and how could it lead to interoperability 
- Chris
    - Even the history of the tree space isn't as well known or broadly distributed.... 
    - Lima, Manuel. [[The Book of Trees]]: Visualizing Branches of Knowledge, 2014. 
        - https://papress.com/products/the-book-of-trees-visualizing-branches-of-knowledge

- Jerry
    - Could we have a [[pattern language]] for this? 
        - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language
    - Ex: Light from Two Walls can become a shorthand for talking about loose rules that trigger understand and contextualization. 
    - Ex: [[1 2 4 all]]
        - [Jerry write up of instrumenting](https://wiki.rel8.dev/tile_-_1-2-4-all_zoom_app)
- Mathew
    - Is there a syntax or thesouras for pattern languages
- Jerry
    - Patern Languages of Pattern Languages
        - https://www.hillside.net/plop/2022/ 
    - Chatbots maybe a solution?
        - Hey I'm intersted in Starting with Tools for Thinking
- Aram
    - Maybe just a question and answer page?
- Jerry
    - And then you could feed it into a Chat Bot
- Mathew
    - How do we help people find the right tool for them
    - How do we help people find the right pattern langugage for them. 
- Aram
    - It seem swe have to interview people first and get them to talk us through it. 
    - Do we need a questionaire? 
- Jerry
    - a smorgasbord of thinking tool users' preferences
    - There is some skill required to pull people out of their over-complexity.
- [ ] questionnaire for thinking tool users? 
    - What are you using this tool for and why? 
    - What did you wish your tool suite did? 
    - In the note taking space a lot of people don't think out the longg term value 
    - Creating one or two notes a day over a year before the big affordances become obvious 
    - what is the long term value of your tool suite and process? 
    - create a 3 minute video of your most typical use case 
        - UX Studies Practice here ?
            - Narrate yourself through the proceess and what you are thinking 
- Chris
    - Very few people get to the 3 or 4 month mark where they see pay off from notetaking.
    - Not many people are writing about it as a benefit either. 
- Mathew
    - We need to use the 5 why technique - we need to ask why a lot
    - Not everyone wants to use notes for creation, some are just collectors. 
- Chris
    - Some people have collect a lot of stuff as the only goal and then the assumption is that [[note taking magic]] happens, but that isn't really the case. 
- People find a system and then want to sell it and that can be a problem
    - [[GTD]] aka [[getting things done]] is an example here
    - [[nick milo]] and [[linking your thinking]] https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/
- [[Memory]] and [[major system]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system as a historical example of people selling intellectual systems or frameworks. This is playing itself out again with note taking tools.

### Notes
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[betaworks]] render event next week about [[tools for thought]] [[2022-08-16]]
        - [[nyc]]
        - https://render.betaworks.com/thinkcamp-a-betaworks-accelerator-program-for-tools-for-thinking-de7e18bf5682
    - how to get a [[posse]] working together
    - [[chorus of voices]]
- [[internet slowness]]
    - [[van jacobson]]
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson_TCP/IP_Header_Compression
- on [[conventions]]
    - [[lower caps]] vs [[initial caps]]
        - eventual fixup
        - eventual convergence :)
    - inclusivity aspect of it: be liberal w.r.t. what you take
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] myhub does the same, lowercase by default everywhere. Based on my (poor) experience with Roam.
    - arguments for/against
        - [[lower caps]]
        - [[initial caps]]
            - more readable
            - the cost of writing caps is helped by tools like [[obsidian]] auto completing links once you type \[\[
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] about unicode coalescing (there's a better word for this) in both directions, pros and cons
            - (...)
            - very used to writing in caps anyway
            - ex: platforms like instagram show how people "exploit" hashtags by using many similar ones to have greater reach
            - a platform could actually coalesce hashtags
                - [[triangle thinking]] ~ [[combinatorial creativity]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] operationalizing communal note taking in preparation for [[betaworks]]
    - how do you do note taking?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] almost on git but not currently
            - most of the public stuff starts in [[hypothes.is]]
            - notes in hypothes.is have permalinks
                - actually have two URLs:
                    - one for the page/resource you annotated followed by a trigger for hypothes.is to open and show the annotation in context
                    - one in the hypothes.is domain which refers to the actual annotation proper
                    - "[[js;dr]] problem"
                - [[Jerry Michalski]]
                    - you can share a highlight to a passage using the current #... convention
                - https://indieweb.org/media_fragment (thanks!)
                - https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/
                - hypothes.is reads the tags and uses it for presenting annotations/highlights
                - https://www.w3.org/annotation/
                - https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/

- [[jerry michalski]] on 
    - #push [[how people think]]
        - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/think/
    - how could we bridge these numbered 1 .. 17 aspects with:
        - notes about the same in other note taking systems
        - hypothes.is annotations on those sections
    - [[mathew lowry]] which level of granularity do you use for your notes? resource/concept/etc. 
        - how to map one to the other?
        - [[jerry michalski]] call this the [[nugget problem]]
        - [[chris aldrich]] [[nugget size]] vs [[zoom levels]]
        - [[jerry michalski]] 
            - [[ted nelson]]
                - [[stretch text]] ~ [[StretchText]] (1967)
                - [[hypertext fiction]]
                - AI(flancian): tell [[armengol]] about this, he was working on something related.
            - Q: is there typing in [[thebrain]] or some other way to distinguish nuggets from e.g. full resources?
                - it could encode this but the way Jerry uses it loses this information
                - Jerry does not use some features just because they slow him down / they take a lot of time
                - [[Mark Trexler]] uses more of these features and is a [[climate change]] expert.
            - [[chris aldrich]] the labels/wikilinks that you used for these are unlikely to be the same other people use.
                - (but once these are known to all be in a particular resource...)
                - [[google search]] including fragment lookup in search results in some sites
                    - engineering focused solution
                - (on striping tracking data from URLs)
                - [[building blocks]]
                    - if it's online, there'a permalink to it somewhere; that's a starting point
                    - [[media fragments]] to dig into text, video, audio
            - [[rel8 pioneers]]
                - where to [[meet]] in this notion of [[idea sex]]?
                    - [[schelling point]]
                        - where would we go in the internet if we couldn't pass information about the place?
                - which places, which formats?
                - [[chris aldrich]] [[permalinks]] and [[wikilinks everywhere]]
                    - negotiating equivalence between wikilinks in different repositories
                    - -> [[agora]]
                    - [[peter hagen]]

                    - [[optimistic linking]]
                        - wishful thinking with dangling links
                    - [[mathew lowry]]
                        - fedwiki for working on convergent links/pages
                        - [[chris aldrich]] creating [[red links]] (in wiki terms), it would be nice to be able to get resolution paths whenever one is clicked (resolve this in X, Y or Z)
                        - [[jerry michalski]] the autocomplete in obsidian could be extended to resolve in expanding circles
                            - #push [[patterns]]
                                - #127 [[intimacy gradient]]

        - in this private language:
            - [[caret]] ~ [[>]] means incorporate into brain
            - cloud means private
        - but there's many views that make sense for different context, different people
        - the all singing, all dancing platform lets you choose your own view based on what you need and shift between them
        - how to solve this?
            - [[flancian]] assume it will work and then make it work :)
                - gather resources of many different types/mental models, all about the same entity/event/thing
                - then try to make them coalesce and translate between each other

### Notes
Jerry's brainf for this meeting: https://bra.in/7j3ewE

- [[Anagora]] shared notes 
- #push [[Commonplace books]]
    - Passed down
    - Example: [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s was left to his family. [[Charles Darwin]] used it and passed it down; it's now in a library
    - Easier to do now on the web while active, harder to preserve 
        - https://indieweb.org/longevity
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
    - Context.center 
        - [Timelines at work](https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-timelines/) - I find timelines to be really useful on understanding and progressing things and finding pattersn and understanding causes.
    - Logging git work and developing in public to make reference easier. 
        - [[Paul Frazee]] - works on [[Beaker]] and other [[Hyper]] projects. 
            - Really cool logging of code work linked with live streaming -  https://paulfrazee.medium.com/building-in-the-open-70ac9dccf1aa 
        - fightwithtools.dev - stream of thought developer notes linked to git commits (still in progress). Trying to make my work more approachable. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]]: What about [[Spaced Repetition]]
    - [[mnemonic medium]]
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: https://app.thebrain.com/brains/3d80058c-14d8-5361-0b61-a061f89baf87/thoughts/6900f8c3-d117-94dc-4996-39241bd989e0/ 
    - Chris Aldrich: [Piotr Woźniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piotr_Wo%C5%BAniak_(researcher))
    - [[mnemonic reading]]
    - [[Anki]] https://apps.ankiweb.net/ 
    - Duolingo
    - A useful version of this is active notetaking while reading articles - perhaps combined
        - Refrence to Genius and other web highlighting/note-taking layers that exist 
    - [[Soren Bjornstad]] formerly of Anki and now at Remnote has lots of work on spaced repetition https://www.sorenbjornstad.com/writing/ 
    - [[David Weinberger]] [[automated summarization]] could play a role here? 
    - [[Mathew Lowry]]: Something I want to add to MyHub
        - Imagine you are creating another piece of content in the same zone - remember you asked this question to yourself 5 months ago?
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: Recently worked on a timeline learning tool - where you get a package of articles in a timeline and it tracks your reading of each article. I wonder if it works with the automated summization content to create learning cards?
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: It might be interesting to see about giving people different orders of articles than just date saved, that they store so they can build narratives out of those cards. 
    - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]: You can pull date from metadata btw. Also: Narrative creation by ordering cards is really interesting. One example of this is Will Wright's tool for Current TV - https://hacktext.com/2011/02/crowd-sourced-television-goes-to-the-next-level-with-bar-karma-and-storymaker-477/
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Founder of https://redforester.com/ is working on something similar that takes elements and can organize them in different ways. I recommended animation to different forks. 
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: Taking notes then reviewing them - asking yourself a question that forces you to produce an answer is a far better method of review that simply re-reading material. Example: [[Cornell Notes]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes 
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]: Five Rs of Note Taking: 
        - Recite
        - Record
        - Reduce
        - Reflect
        - Review 
    - [[Mathew Lowery]]: Do you have a set of pre-generated questions that you can slot specific things into or is it more freeform? (To Chris)
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]: [[Cloze]] process where, when you are writing it/taking up the notes you use brackets that mean you are already writing the card. 
        - Have to make sure the questions are not too open ended. 
        - Usually one or two sentences with only a few things missing. 
        - I use it very sparingly because I have other methods I prefer to [[Spaced Repetition]]
        - Actively linking notes also helps a great deal. 
    - book: Memory Craft: Improve Your Memory with the Most Powerful Methods in History (2019) by [[Lynne Kelly]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] AR projects seem to lack informational, helper, curational stuff. 
- Useful concept memory palaces: loci
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci
- [[David Weinberger]] 
    - background in philosophy 
    - for past 30 years writing about the ways in which technology effects the ways we think about things. Focused on Machine Learning for the past 5 years. 
    - Working at Google on Ethics and AI
- [[David Weinberger]] - Writing Notes Process
    - Hobbyist programmer
    - Wrote app that lets me take notes in plain old [[ascii]] (text)
    - bibliographic info at top
        - page number, note and tag
    - took notes on a ton of info that way
    - then built an app that let me shunt it all into databases 
    - Went back to Zotero yesterday
        - Couldn't get it to work and it doesn't work the way I want it to. 
    - [yes](https:yes.com) 
- [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]] 
    - I liked [[Endnote]] when someone else was paying for it. 
    - [[Zotero]] is great, not for me really because I'm no longer an academic, but lots of great ways to plug in to it to make it for me.
    - For arguing on the web, that's what I use context.center for. 
- [[Chris Aldrich]]: 
    - Mendeley seems to be shutting down
    - Zotero is useful for annotating PDFs and now does export of notes from .pdfs as of version 6.0
- [[Jerry Michalski]] big charts and zooming in and out of them is one of the problems we need to take on. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]] 
    - [[Harvard Growth Lab]] has an amazing infographic about economics
        - https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/
- Reminds me of - https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder
- [[Cesar Hidalgo]] - https://centerforcollectivelearning.org/
- What do we take on next? Agenda for next week:
    - How to explain the shared memory concept? 
    - A lot of different answers. 
    - Maybe understanding what the technical format is for a "memory" so it can be shared effectively. 
- Where are the YouTube listings of our calls?
    - In Jerry's brain 
    - In the Mattermost chat 

### Action items / #TODO

- [ ] invite others
    - who?
    - if we write it down in a canonical place we can distribute this (useful, social) work
- [ ] set up cross-review?
    - [[flancian]] would be willing and glad to review other people's writing, perhaps we could do this as a group?
        - full disclosure: I'm also writing a chapter :)
        - Always glad to read and make suggestions! - [[Aram Zucker-Scharff]]
- What else might we publish? Potentially on the site
- [ ] [[let's share notes]]
    - [ ] start integrating pattern languages
        - [ ] build a [[meta pattern language]]

    - [[flancian]] thinks of Anagora as a reference implementation of [[agora protocol]], which is this protocol
    - What are the standard objects that move back and forth on this protocol? What is the shapes and how can they enable information exchange and connection? 
        - Does this connect with ActivityPub? Could we send objects and federate "brains" in this way?

- going back to the [[flatten]] problem (going from n notes to a long form text)
    - [[flancian]] two possible approaches
        - define a [[dsl]] for flattening/assembling (transclusion helps; pull, push in the Agora goes in this direction)
        - train and use large language models with notes being part of prompts
    - [[dimensionality problem]]
        - [[planarity]] as first target when processing a high dimensional graph

### Notes
- Where to track a recurring agenda/our goals?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] https://wiki.rel8.dev
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] something that has worked for indieweb is having people who join show a token of interest; e.g. try to improve something for someone
        - i.e. we can talk all day, but improvements to real systems are what we should be shooting towards
        - we could focus here on integrating systems that already exist (the ones we're building or fostering individually) as a group
    - [[flancian]] let's try to spot patterns (...)
- [[aram zucker-scharff]]
    - works for the [[The Washington Post]]
    - developed [[pressforward]], a tool for [[wordpress]]- http://pressforward.org/
    - building easy to use websites, archives -- in a way that allows them to interact with each other
        - https://context.center/
        - https://github.com/AramZS/contexter
        - https://fightwithtools.dev/projects/context-pages/
    - [Aram on the Fediverse](https://indieweb.social/@Chronotope) 
    - interested in solving [[misinformation]] and [[archival]]
    - for note taking, [[markdown]] on [[git]]
        - [[flancian]] https://anagora.org
- [[fellowship of the link]], a crowdsourced introduction :)
    - [[zettelkasten]], [[commonplace books]], [[tools for thought]], [[personal knowledge graphs]], [[interlays]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] lots of projects in this space are trying to sell something; but we care most about the [[commons]]
    - how do we take idea capturing and generating and link them into a healthy [[knowledge commons]]?
- [[logseq]] model as it relates to the commons
    - taking VC money seems slightly worrying as they'll want to be repayed
    - https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
    - [[logseq]] looks close to [[obsidian]]
        - do we have enough variety of approaches?
    - paying for services is fine
- [[you need a wiki]]
- [[agenda]]
    - #push [[rel8]]
        - https://wiki.rel8.dev
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[rel8 pioneers]]
    - [[flancian]] let's all push our projects onto a shared space and talk by default about interlinking and integrating them?
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] let's start a list of resources and repositories? 
        - this may help to bootstrap a [[commons]]
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[mycelium]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[liberating voices pattern language]]
        - [[1 2 4 all]] ~ [[one two four all]]

- let's bring to the next meeting -- a list of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- [[affordances]]
    - [[wikilinks]] and [[metadata]] as key to the [[commons]]
- [[meta]] about chat
    - let's prefer the [[mattermost]] to [[jitsi chat]]
- [[Jerry Michalski]] what's the difference between [[indieweb]] vs [[fediverse]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is a subset of [[indieweb]]
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[indieweb]] is based around the notion of having your own website and building your identity around it
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[fediverse]] is based around the notion of your identity being hosted in an instance like [[mastodon.social]]
 
 - Let's discuss what we wrote to [[rel8]], our lists of:
    - [[repositories]]
    - [[tools]]
    - [[projects]]
    - (that we want to integrate/cross reference/discuss)
- People who need access to the repo (github usernames):
    - flancian
    - aramzs
    - bouncepaw
    - chrisaldrich
    - mathewlowry
- Let's talk about [[search engines]]
    - https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/2022-07-02-projviding-meaningful-search-results-without-own-index.html 
    - [[queries as addresses]]
- Phone service vs Internet service analogy: https://boffosocko.com/2022/07/05/economic-models-in-social-media-and-a-better-way-forward/
- Let's onboard everybody to the [[fediverse]]!
    - [[mastodon]] app is actually good to bootstrap/choose an instance
- Dump your ActivityPub IDs here ;)
    - @flancian@social.coop
    - @chrisaldrich@boffosocko.com
    - @bouncepaw@lor.sh 
- What do we see as our long term goal?
    - [[flancian]] let's integrate repositories and tools and write [[science fiction]] together :) how could our tools, platforms, the internet, the world at large look like by [[2025]], [[2030]]?
    - [[Mathew Lowry]] is focusing on producing the [[pkg book]] chapter and would love to do research and writing in this space
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] would like to participate in exploration and prototyping; illustrate and broadcast interesting ideas for others to pick up; analyze what it will take to deliver this by the next decade; organize activities
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] appreciate the idea of [[shared wikis]] that can communicate back and forth with each other
        - [[flancian]] we should invite [[ward cunningham]]!
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] history of the medium
        - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[songlines: the power and promise]]

### Notes
- [[Jerry Michalski]] 
    - #push [[rel8]] 
        - #go https://www.rel8.dev
            - (a [[google site]])
            - https://www.rel8.dev/wiki is embedded above
        - "relating ideas, documents, perspectives and people"
    - (Jerry is using [[obsidian]] plus [[obsidian sync]] for this)
    - [[short term]], [[medium term]] and [[long term]] goals for [[rel8]]
    - [[short term]]
        - define: how do we share notes?
        - import [[jerry's brain]] from [[json]] into [[obsidian]] and [[excalidraw]]
            - [[Zsolt Viczián]] (https://www.zsolt.blog/) is interested in doing this
        - what do we put on [[rel8]]?
            - a list of formats/processes that are sufficient for us to 'store our brain' comfortably?
            - [[Mathew Lowry]] user requirements exercise
        - [[flancian]] on a hub architecture for integrating brains and negotiating exchange (format conversion)
            - [[underlay]], [[interlay]], [[overlay]] as per [[metasj]]
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] decentralized or centralized?
            - decentralized is the idea (or distributed)
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] what should we be using as way of standards to create this?
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] text -> markdown -> html
            - (shared by default is convenient but can be problematic)
            - text as the basic standard
            - then add links, e.g. markdown or org mode
            - then html, microformats, json, yaml can be layered on top
            - exchanged p2p (distributed) or via hubs
        - [[Mathew Lowry]] interested on web mentions, fediverse as they exist in the data exchange ecosystem
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] how can you design a minimum building block that is interoperable with other pieces?
            - [[web mentions]] takes the older ideas of pingback/trackback, strips them down to the essentials. it's a notification system via [[post]] requests.
            - [[mastodon]] could support web mentions (there was talk about this a few years back)
            - if X writes a post about URL A by Y, Y will be pinged
            - Y receives the notification, can do some spot checks (does the call refer to a post that actually has the expected link), and then does whatever it wants with it
            - [[activitypub]] could take advantage of [[webmentions]] as a building block, but it mostly doesn't
                - [[kevin marks]] (sp?) added microformats to [[mastodon]]
       - [[flancian]] decentralized vs distributed approach, web3 and all
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] technical details vs ease of use
       - [[flancian]] two directions we could go in:
           - text as the standard makes it easy to use actually as users can write text wherever they want, a priori
           - focusing on making existing tools and ecosystems easier to use/onboard to
       - [[Chris Aldrich]]
           - high tech skills: you set up your own mastodon instance, agora, etc.
           - medium: you produce information, content but someone else pays the [[admin tax]] (you contribute to an instance)
           - (spectrum)
           - no technical expertise
           - #push [[blot im]] is very useful, imports from whenever you want
               - [[flancian]] nice, and it's open source: https://github.com/davidmerfield/blot
               - wanted to do this for the Agora so this is super helpful
       - [[Mathew Lowry]]
           - who are we building this for?
           - "instagram user" might be too wide a net?
           - disconnect from building a knowledge graph and writing for others
       - [[Jerry Michalski]]
       - #push [[nuggets, remedies and pov]]
           - [[nuggetization]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related
       - [[public]] vs [[private]] as a default
           - [[public]] as default seems better to seemingly most of us
       - [[Chris Aldrich]] mostly these days notes start in [[hypothes.is]]
           - periodically gets feedback about how cool it is to work in public
       - [[Jerry Michalski]] [[fedwiki]]
           - [[twitter]] user 509 here (!)
       - [[diego de la hera]]
           - going back to what we have in mind and where our ideas overlap
           - not really sure what he's expecting here, but a tool that would be interesting would be like this:
               - like the agora, where you could see it from two different perspectives
                   - as a personal tool, where an individual user decides which graphs converge on the agora
                   - "mix and match" feeds and gardens, an aggregator
                   - like an [[agora view]]
               - another agora is closer to anagora.org, where you push many graphs to a place but where the owners of the repos decided that in advance
           - an extension or tool could be written so that the nodes you see could be actual URLs, and incoming/outgoing links would be those around your internet context (social graph, feeds)
           - [[Jerry Michalski]]

           - which links are mentioned in that tweet, that post?
           - about the [[great fungus]]

## 2022-06-09
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Inviting others
    - [[flancian]] been inviting people already, but would be like to use some kind of policy?
    - [[Jerry Michalski]] suggest to use the Mattermost to coordinate; use this space to consider together our goals and attract others like this
       - [[mattermost]] https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-fellowship-of-the-link
    - let's use the list of people in the [[doc]] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAourQe_MKh0uWomLsS_V5ea3zm30g8paE49X56jIHs/edit
        - to brainstorm on who to invite if you want to discuss a priori
    - [[flancian]] invited Dan because of his interested in the space + his experience with web standards
- [[Jerry Michalski]]
    - [[web]] https://www.fellowshipofthelink.org/
    - who wants admin? :)
        - 0@flancia.org
        - delahera@gmail.com
        - christopherjaldrich@gmail.com
    - we could also start groups in social networks, e.g. linkedin
        - [[flancian]] [[mastodon]]?
        - got stuck in [[choosing an instance]]
            - [[diego de la hera]] mastodon.social could be seen as the default
            - (instance delegation could be interesting, web of trust like)

            - you are given so much choice it's almost too much (in the indieweb)
            - [[Jerry Michalski]] templates, walkthroughs add a lot of value
            - [[Chris Aldrich]] you need either a lot of time or people motivated because they're building business
            - [[peter kaminski]] introduced [[Jerry Michalski]] to [[obsidian]]
            - on straightforward vs powerful tools
            - [[diego de la hera]] on the power of forks
                - e.g. [[Chris Aldrich]]'s setup is something we could fork to bootstrap a new user's environment
                - people have copy/pasted Chris's website already, full pages at a time :)
       - [[flancian]] [[map of the fediverse]]

                    - -> [[argument mapping]]?
                    - [[argumentation theory]]
                    - [[stephen toulmin]] -> [[toulmin model of argument]]
                - [[the big fungus]] == https://thebigfungus.org
                - interested in the scaffolding, infrastructure to share ideas
            - [[think camp]] funds startups in this space
                - "profitable businesses that feed the [[commons]]"
        - read an interesting article today, conservative point of view with good arguments even though some disagreeable premises
            - how do we put this article up to scrutiny and learn from it together?
                - -> [[web annotations]]?
                - [[gyuri lajos]]
                    - **[[Jerry Michalski]] let's have a group sync with Gyuri?**
                    - [[Chris Aldrich]] trails are related to [[vannevar bush]]'s
        - wishlist for [[fotl]]: how do these parts fit together?
            - how do we make it so that our notes provide maximum utility, spread through the big fungus
    - [[Chris Aldrich]] would like to focus on how to
        - make it all work together
        - make the systems be easy to use
        - make something that is as simple to understand as facebook?
        - I'd like to see [[commonplace books]] that can "talk" to each other.
        - "the [[stream]] flows by too fast"
            - turning streams into gardens
            - [[neil]] from the Agora has great writing on streams vs gardens, how they relate to each other - https://doubleloop.net/
- [[john borthwick]] at [[betaworks]] has funding for small projects [[think camp]]
- Watch parties
    - [[connection series]]
        - watch these, take notes/diagrams and share/interop
        - -> [[books, paintings, movies, ideas that shaped many people's lives]]
            - https://bra.in/5pxdW6
    - [[dan whaley]] youtube annotations are a side project / hobby
        - [[docdrop]] https://docdrop.org/
- [[diego de la hera]]
    - web annotations were mentioned; thought of two connections
        - [[peter hagen]] -> [[lindylearn]] https://lindylearn.io/ and specifically https://annotations.lindylearn.io/new/
            - social platform where you would find what other people are annotating and join the conversation
            - provides a discovery layer for what others are reading and thinking about
        - [[chrome]] is also tackling annotations
        - [[worldbrain]], [[memex]]?
        - it seems like here we want to work more on the level of how to connect different annotation tools at a (federated?) layer
            - perhaps what we need is an integration device at this layer, e.g. [[wikilinks]]

## 2022-06-02
- Attending: [[Jerry Michalski]], [[diego de la hera]], [[flancian]], [[Chris Aldrich]]
- Our personal history
    - Diego en Córdoba
    - Jerry Michalski pasos por sudamérica, ahora en Portland
    - Eduardo de Buenos Aires, ahora en Suiza
- Relationships locally and globally
- Jerry: [[open global mind]] meeting just before
    - Send email to sociate@gmail.com to sign up :)
- ([[Chris Aldrich]] joined, introductions)
    - [[Jerry Michalski]]
        - [[the brain]]
        - [[chris]] any shares in the company?
        - not anymore
        - do you have backups?
        - occasionally :) but the format is a big bag of [[json]] objects, not bery interoperable
            - wishlist: [[open global mind]] platform instead
    - [[diego de la hera]]
        - hypothes.is user, contributor as the maintainer of the unofficial extension for firefox; working with [[wikimedia foundation]]
        - met Chris through hypothes.is
    - [[Chris Aldrich]]
        - background: biomedical and electrical engineer, been on the web since the early 90s
        - [[indieweb]] / https://indieweb.org
        - [[open web backup]], strong belief in owning your own domain, your own data, your own identity
        - done work on genetics, but germane: spent a lot of time in the [[entertainment industry]] as it overlaps with the open web
        - massive amount of data
        - history, culture as intertwined with knowledge tools
        - current focus on wikis and note taking tools
- [[Jerry Michalski]] wishful thinking for a design in this space
    - it should allow all users to view data through their chosen tools
    - sometimes you change tools as you shift what you need to do (they are good at different modes of thinking)
    - [[planes]]
        - [[multi plane camera]], [[disney history]]
            - similar to layers in photoshop/gimp
        - bought https://www.playnz.dev

        - [[leaf cutting ants]]
        - ([[diego de la hera]] worked with them)
        - [[symbiotic relationship]] with the fungus
    - [[diego de la hera]] we mentioned a diversity of tools here:
        - closed and open
        - wiki like and otherwise
        - ...but as long as these platforms provide this data in a documented way, do we need a central tool? wouldn't collaboration emerge even without a central tool?
        - [[jerry]] +1 -- the big fungus is a metaphor for the result of this collaboration. But [[playnz]] might be an [[mvp]]/[[demo]] or just an experiment/playground for interoperability.
        - are these tools perhaps already playns?
            - they might be, yes.
        - [[Chris Aldrich]] [[progressive enhancement]] is key
            - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement
            - how can we take all these tools and build an architecture that supports progressive enhancement?
            - we start with plain text as the base, then you can add things like markdown/html, then you add photos/media
        - [[flancian]] problems and opportunities:
            - exploring hub architecture vs full graph integration
            - lossiness as you interop through tools, playns
            - complexity of integrations
                - [[Chris Aldrich]] pairwise compatibility is a nightmare

    - possible [[lingua francas]]
- [[Chris Aldrich]] "The world lost so much because Vannevar Bush didn't use the word commonplace book in his article As We May Think."
    - how can we take open tools like [[logseq]], or semi-open like [[obsidian]], and create a reusable store
    - [[blot]] == https://blot.im
    - [[granary]] == https://granary.io/ for translating between silo formats as well as feed formats [[rss]], [[atom]], [[h-feed]], [[JSONfeed]], etc.
