    - [[jerry michalski]]
        - Grew up in [[Lima]] and then [[Buenos Aires]]!
        - Buenos Aires in the 1960s!
        - The status of [[South America]] and [[Africa]].
        - The role of the [[catholic church]] in the problems of the continent.
            - [[liberation theology]]
            - [[curas tercermundistas]]
            - [[bergoglio]]
    - [[samuel klein]]
        - brother lives in [[Santiago]] :)  ([not my brother](https://jhoansebastiangrey.com/))
    - -> [[jerry's brain]] [[cybersyn]] [[salvador allende]]
        - #book [[overthrow]]
- how do we frame this conversation?
    - we have a lot of things we could talk about, what's a nice useful way to start this conversation?
    - [[samuel klein]]
        - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
        - [[fellowship]]
        - [[stress testing new technology]] in this space
- [[wikilinks everywhere]]
    - [[jerry]] how we handle links seems very powerful
        - "how can I be the [[chuck yeager]] of a the new platform"
        - would love to get out of the current tool into something freer
        - [[500000]] nodes, [[1000000]] links
            - [[flancian]] FYI the Agora is small but has 1:4 linking ratio currently
        - "linking freely but not promiscuously helps find things later"
        - [[note taking]] vs [[thebrain]]
            - note taking does happen in the brain
            - but Jerry doesn't actually use the notes field per se
            - it's not even outliner mode: it's an actual graph that Jerry navigates dynamically
                - what about the time dimension?
                - [[thebrain]] timestamps everything, but it's not really retrievable via an API
            - wish: interop between tools that support every useful workflow
        - #push [[open global mind]] group, every Thu there is a check in call, as an example of taking notes here
            - ![](https://doc.anagora.org/uploads/upload_a6763abac582c19f6140b7f68bf880d0.png)
- [[thebrain]]
    - Jerry's their largest user.
    - Has never paid for it.
    - Freeing Jerry's Brain
        - what else might we do with the structure that it's easy for him to capture / has been captured?
        - Exploring migration to other platforms. 
    - Asked for an [[rss]] feed twenty years ago (!)
    - No other tool seems to be up to the task of migrating to it.
    - Export is a [[json]] dump
        - Has imported it into a [[nosql]] database ~1y ago
        - Some thoughts are [[private]] though, which adds some complexity. Those need to be filtered out.
    - Would love to offer his brain to others to take a snapshot and start building on it.
        - [[samuel]] [[huggingmind]]?
            - [[content hash]] based tools have failed so far
            - if you get into [[decentralized sharing]], there are:
                - [[named based models]]
                - [[content hash models]]
                    - no clustering, no updates, need to solve equivalence and relationships in a different level (ipfs has ipdns)
            - both of these are missing the higher level point: what humans want to share is [[concepts]]
                - "you want the latest [[human genome]]"
                - "you want to find a map of [[charging stations]]"
                    - it'd make sense to compose canonical lists at different levels (city, region, global)
                - [[coordination problem]]
                - [[hashtags]] as an example of grassroot technology
                - [[wikilinks]] as acceptable search queries for whatever you're trying to store
                    - [[metasj]] [[chatoyancy]]
                - [[query based event addressing]]
                    - [[search engine company]] experimented with crowdsourced query editing
                    - Jerry: "do you have any other [[vector]] into it"
    - [[flancian]] have you done a [[mindmeld]] with someone else?
        - Jerry knows one more advanced user, but [[thebrain]] doesn't offer any way to do this
        - the exported bag of [[json]] objects is available, people are interested
        - [[free jerry's brain]] group, meets Mondays at 1PM Pacific, part of [[open global mind]]
        - also [[mattermost]] has a channel dedicated to it
        - [[peter kaminski]]
        - where to chat?
            - https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/tips
            - [[matrix]] 
            - [[google groups]]
            - [[fellowship of the link]]
        - [[zsolt]] did a [[excalidraw]] + [[obsidian]] mashup
            - "https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsolt-viczian/ TheBrain-like graph-based navigation in Obsidian with Excalidraw, Dataview, and Hover Editor (V2)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plYobK-VufM"
            - [[metasj]]: [[bretv]] is great and would be a good addition to these conversations
        - a healthy way forward is to have a series of design sessions for the interop ecosystem, identify components, identify the pieces that will make it easy for others to adopt the system and get value from it
        - [[jerry]] [[Rel8]] Use Cases: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWkwOefBPZY
        - Jerry: "sharing our notes to fix civilization"
        - Replacing [[powerpoint]] with better storytelling tool
            - [[prezi]] was great and then regressed :(
            - there's an opportunity in this space
            - [[powerpoint killers]][

            - [[codex editor]] == [[codex]] in the Agora
- questions:
    - chat platform: [[mattermost]] or something else?
    - [[open]] by default or not?
        - open
    - build conceptual outline
        - [[google doc]]?
        - [[node]] it?
- start an [[awesome foundation]] chapter?
