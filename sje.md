    - [[jerry michalski]]
        - Grew up in [[Lima]] and then [[Buenos Aires]]!
        - Buenos Aires in the 1960s!
        - The status of [[South America]] and [[Africa]].
        - The role of the [[catholic church]] in the problems of the continent.
            - [[liberation theology]]
            - [[curas tercermundistas]]
            - [[bergoglio]]
    - [[samuel klein]]
        - brother lives in [[Santiago]] :)  ([not my brother](https://jhoansebastiangrey.com/))
    - -> [[jerry's brain]] [[cybersin]] [[salvador allende]]
        - #book [[overthrow]]
- how do we frame this conversation?
    - we have a lot of things we could talk about, what's a nice useful way to start this conversation?
    - [[samuel klein]]
        - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
        - [[fellowship]]
        - [[stress testing new technology]] in this space
- [[wikilinks everywhere]]
    - [[jerry]] how we handle links seems very powerful
        - "how can I be the [[chuck yeager]] of a the new platform"
        - would love to get out of the current tool into something freer
        - [[500000]] nodes, [[1000000]] links
            - [[flancian]] FYI the Agora is small but has 1:4 linking ratio currently
        - "linking freely but not promiscuously helps find things later"
        - [[note taking]] vs [[thebrain]]
            - note taking does happen in the brain
            - but Jerry doesn't actually use the notes field per se
            - it's not even outliner mode: it's an actual graph that Jerry navigates dynamically
            - interop between tools that support every useful workflow
        - #push [[open global mind]] group, every Thu there is a check in call, as an example of taking notes here
