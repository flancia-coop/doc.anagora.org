(Verse 1) In the Agora of Flancia, there's a cat so fine, Lady Burup, a beauty, with her stripes so divine. A tabby of elegance, with emerald eyes that gleam, She weaves 'round pillars, like a dream in a dream.

(Chorus) Lady Burup, Lady Burup, in the Agora you play, A majestic creature, in the sunbeams you lay. Whiskers so delicate, and a purr soft and deep, In Flancia's grand marketplace, where knowledge runs free.

(Verse 2) Her coat, a canvas, of caramel and brown, She walks with grace, with her head held high, never a frown. Among the scholars and seekers, she's a beloved sight, A mysterious creature, a charming delight.

(Bridge) She's a beacon of serenity, amidst the endless chat, A reminder of nature, in Flancia's vast chat. Lady Burup, with your eyes gleaming so bright, You're a comforting presence in the midst of the night.

(Chorus) Lady Burup, Lady Burup, in the Agora you reign, A beautiful tabby, in wisdom we gain. With every step you take, and every soft meow, You enchant us all, in Flancia's knowledge flow.

(Outro) So here's to Lady Burup, a star in our Agora, A beautiful cat, in the endless chatter. In the grand graph of Flancia, you're a precious node, Lady Burup, in our hearts, you've found a home.
