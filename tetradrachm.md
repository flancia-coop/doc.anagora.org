The tetradrachm (Greek: τετράδραχμον, translit. tetrádrachmon) was an Ancient Greek silver coin equivalent to four drachmae.[1] In Athens it replaced the earlier "heraldic" type of didrachms and it was in wide circulation from c. 510 to c. 38 BC.[2]

The Athenian tetradrachm was perhaps the most widely used coin in the Greek world before the time of Alexander the Great.

The silver tetradrachm is believed to be the coin given to Judas for betraying Jesus.[3]
