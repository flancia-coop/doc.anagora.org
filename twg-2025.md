## 2025 roadmap

These are projects currently being run by the Tech Working Group, together with high level next steps we have identified for them. We also make use of this section to provide a 2024 recap :)

- wiki.social.coop
   - In 2024 we kept it running, we fixed bugs :)
   - Still need to upload backups to [[s3]] and test restores.
   - Pretty stable/usable as of the time of writing.
- SSO
   - Through 2024 auth.social.coop has gotten more users, mostly through the wiki
   - Next steps:
       - Backup/restore of users
       - Syncing users with other sources of truth we have currently:
           - loomio
           - social.coop instance (Mastodon)
    - Possible related projects:
        - Nextcloud with SSO
        - New services, like messaging
        - Some of these could make the cost of coordination of social.coop activities and events lower cost and more inclusive
- Mastodon (main instance) maintenance
   - Many upgrades took place, and we moved to a new server :)
   - Next steps:
       - Move to Hometown: yay or nay? It's looking like nay.
       - But what about the [[Fediversalist papers]]?
- Bonfire as a possible second
   - bonfire.social.coop is still nominally up for experimental usage.
   - Next steps:
       - Update this (it runs on [[coop cloud]])
       - Configure SSO (Mayel sent a build to try)
       - Test federation fixes once they're there
- Monitoring and alerting
    - Monitor further items in datadog
    - Or adopt a free monitoring platform (which?)
    - Items we need to make sure we cover:
        - Basic uptime monitoring
        - Instance latency and errors
- [[Data sovereignity]]
    - Progress on backups and restores: we completed a restore of our postgresql database and used it to validate assumptions about our database state, much relieving TWG members :)
- [[Bots]]:
    - We would like to help [[ntnsndr]] host his bot, and the community host bots in general.
    - Next steps here is to run [[boost bot]] for the community, in particular the CWG would like to [[boost introductions]].
- Architecture
    - Convergence between [[ansible]]-based and [[coop cloud]]-based infrastructure might still be desirable in the future, but better bang-for-the-buck might be found elsewhere.
    - For [[alpha.social.coop]] we decided to get a new VPS and use Ansible as that's a more representative setup of what we have in prod for the time being.
        - This is blocking doing [[2k characters]] responsibly, but in our opinion worth the wait.
- Other
    - In 2024 we had our first [[open house]]
- Organizing circle participation might yield a steady stream of feedback from other working groups.
- The recurring domain name ownership issue is being tackled by the FWG.
