June 30, 2023
Meeting Participants:

Quick Check-ins:

Beautiful weather but quite packed summer
About the event
(Which event?)
Moderated panel for digital cooperativism
Coop development, exit to community
Interesting conversations about compromise, there will be a shared recording
Matt
Been getting hotter and drier but not too rough
Tonight will play coopoly (!)
Rocking the suspender look


Regular Operations:
Compensation Log [approved] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QJTAcpOuEnliaHvb4fxIy_TxowBepv4EyOsJD4ZLgZE/edit?usp=sharing
How not to claim it?
For now, by default just claim it and if you want donate it back
But with the new organization circle structure, maybe the CWG will also just get a discretionary budget and be able to allocate it however
On-call schedule for July:
7/3 Matt
7/10 Eduardo
7/17 Sam
7/24 Emi
Action: Emi to update schedule: https://share.mayfirst.org/apps/calendar/p/KG92DPwX3ww442AD/dayGridMonth/now
Or maybe we can rotate this?

Moderation issues:
https://social.coop/admin/reports/594

Registration issues:
next action: clean up site / remove duplicate pages (with wiki). Maybe next Monday.

Updates from Tech WG:
single sign on will take a few months
perhaps move to hometown this year
create proposal on loomio
    
Passage of Organizing Circle Proposal and follow up:
65 (18%) of the 356 social.coop members on Loomio have voted, with 61 Agree, 2 Disagree, and 2 Abstain.
This is a small slice of the overall instance population (~2k), but seems to about par for the course for Loomio polls (even high volume/interest ones)
The next steps are:
recruit new people to CWG Ops Team
working groups each choose one person to be on the Organizing Circle
Community Working Group Ops Team
Tech Working Group
Eduardo will ask active members
Finance Working Group
[legal?]
those people will organize the sortition process for choosing the At Large member.
Questions :)
What is an at large member?
A member of the organization group which is not part of a working group too
Is it realistic to put together this structure?
working groups are relatively easy to ramp up to because of the amount of structure, whereas the organizing circle will require a lot extra
What will the organization circle be tasked with doing?
Intended to help the other circles function; coordinate discussion that affects all of social.coop
What is sortition?
Like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition#/media/File:AGMA_Kleroterion.jpg
How do we get this rolling?
Realistically Matt will probably have to take the initiative
Do we want to increase the participation in governance, ratio wise, w.r.t. all instance users?
Emi: we tried to do a loomio audit at one point.
How many *active* users do we have?
518
Matt: tools give us affordances but what we actually need is active participation/organizing. The circle is meant to encourage and enable.
Action (Eduardo): ask the TWG who the emissary should be.
This decision will be re-opened for review in January of 2024.

Rotation of Ops Team Coordinators:
    This could interact with us sending an emmisary to the organization circle.
Tasks
communications coordinator
note taking
record keeping
updating loomio
publishing minutes
updating calendars
Team coordinator
coordinating meeting 
setting agenda
facilitating
start with rotating coordinators within the current ops team on a monthly basis
Action: post on the instance soliciting new members? (Emi)
document all these things -- where?
https://wiki.social.coop/wiki/Community_Working_Group_Ops_Team is the place?

Social.Coop General Assembly
Let's hold for Mariah
Original timeline was September

Meet.Coop Evolution:
Mike Hales resigned from his coordination role
Open question: governance structure for meet.coop beyond the tech/moderation aspects that web.tv is taking on.
As in: in which way does meet.coop differ from web.tv moving forward?
figuring out better governance
It shouldn't be too difficult for social.coop to take that on
Matt: all that would mean would be hosting periodic discussion and a forum platform to make decisions over what happens to meet.coop
Emi: what kind of decisions woud have to be made?
Basic things like 'how much to charge', 'should we keep this going or close it down', etc.
Emi: maybe we should put this up on loomio? It seems like there's probably a lot of parts to this potentially, and the scope of meet.coop is larger than social.coop members.
tech move to web.tv
how much of the resources for managing tech
unclear if there will be enough to pay for a community person
default: meet.coop becomes one of the services that web.tv provides, and they also handle governance. Essentially it becomes a coop-provided-service instead of a service cooperative.
spin off federation of authentication layer
don't know how to do that yet
perhaps keep the door open to other deployments (in other jurisdiction)
Eduardo and Matt to keep taking part in meetings for the time being
the only thing meet.coop has stopped doing is custom events
Matt to hand off meet.coop registrations to the CWG ops team

Next meeting: Aug 4th super early as usual.
