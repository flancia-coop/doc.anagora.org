- a [[book]], maybe.

Always feel free to fail. Free yourself from suffering if you can, free others: this is the whole of Flancia as [[Sila]].

But I'm getting ahead of myself; please allow me to introduce myself.

I'm a [[Flancian]]. This means I always try to be public with my thoughts and follow the [[Principle of Charity]] in discussion with others while attempting to maximize loving-kindness. To learn how to communicate with you better I started writing this.

How are you today?

- [[very well]]
- [[well]]
- [[not so well]]
