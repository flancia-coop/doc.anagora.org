Always feel free to fail. Free yourself from suffering if you can and free others: this is the whole of [[Flancia]] as a practice maybe.

But I'm getting ahead of myself; please allow me to introduce myself. I'm a [[Flancian]]. In practice, you can think of this as meaning that I try to be open about my thoughts by default, follow the [[Principle of Charity]] in discussion and attempt to increase overall [[loving-kindness]]. 

To learn how to communicate with you better I started writing this.


How are you today?

- [[very well]]
- [[well]]
- [[not so well]]
