## Definición inicial
The Ekumen - The Hainish ¿Coalition, confederation? 

Our objective is to create a more welcoming, safe, and humane Fediverse. In order to do that, we
+ imagine, explore, design, prototype and test socio-technical systems (agreements, processes and tools) and
+ share information and knowledge for everyone to make this systems better. 

We start with a small groups of people from various instances who share values of equity, respect, diversity, self governance and non-discrimination.

The key to shared and increased power is the correlation of sharing and receiving information between instances in a clear, trusted, and guarded space.

We can understand and act as a group in ways that no one could do alone.

## Plan
1. Meet and get to know each other. Check if there are other that need to be here now. 
2. Research previous related projects. Learn from them.
3. Design the agreements and processes.
