# Fediverse Enhancement Proposals

FEP's are specification documents meant to enhance the [[ActivityPub]] protocol with additional mechanisms that developers can take into account. The FEP's are hosted on Codeberg at https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep and discussed in the [[SocialHub]] developer community at https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks
