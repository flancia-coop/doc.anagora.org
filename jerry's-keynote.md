# Per-slide feedback

- On 'impossible' intro slide: 'long' and abstract slides like this would probably work better standing up/on a stage, but the examples you gave otherwise seemed like they could have done with some 'slide support'.
- You started with this question but it wasn't clear to me how it related to the objective of the session. 
- Two angles:
    - Generative AI
    - Trust
- ...but angles for what? Five minutes in I had forgotten :) I think it was about effective change? But it could have gotten a slide to reinforce/make it clear at the beginning.
    - this slide also seemed very small/bare after the previous one
- [[joy line]] angle
    - the 'lesser car' looked fine to me -- maybe you need a worse example? :D
- [[rethink constraints]] slide came later and cleared up the question I had above -- I think you probably want another version of this slide early on

(~fifteen minute mark)
