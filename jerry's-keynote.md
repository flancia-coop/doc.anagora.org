# "Per-slide" feedback

- On 'impossible' intro slide: 'long' and abstract slides like this would probably work better standing up/on a stage, but the examples you gave otherwise seemed like they could have done with some 'slide support'.
- You started with this question but it wasn't clear to me how it related to the objective of the session. 
- Two angles:
    - Generative AI
    - Trust
- ...but angles for what? Five minutes in I had forgotten :) I think it was about effective change? But it could have gotten a slide to reinforce/make it clear at the beginning.
    - this slide also seemed very small/bare after the previous one
- [[joy line]] angle
    - the 'lesser car' looked fine to me -- maybe you need a worse example? :D
- [[rethink constraints]] slide came later and cleared up the question I had above -- I think you probably want another version of this slide early on

(~fifteen minute mark)

- [[traffic calming]]
- [[generative ai]] moving the [[impossible line]]
- framework -- [[4s]]:
    - [[see shift shape set]]
    - [[see]]
        - slides on what 'see' means seem like they maybe aren't as needed and you could go straight to your quote.
        - [[constraints]]
            - nice examples for organizational vs personal
            - the odd benefits of being an outcast -- interesting facts about [[quakers]]
        - on flipping away from [[systems designed from mistrust]]
        - [[John Taylor Gatto]] on the [[Hidden Curriculum of Schooling]]:
            - Stay in the class where you belong
            - Turn on and off when I tell you to
            - Surrender your will to a predestined chain of command
            - Only I determine what curriculum you will study
            - Your  self-respect should depend on an observer's measure of your worth
            - You are being watched
            - -> this was great but I felt that you maybe shifted away from this slide without fully driving the point across.
        - Your mission tomorrow
            - Enumerate your constraints
            - Examine your assumptions
            - Look for imbalances
            - How ought things be?
    - [[shift]]
        - Liked its description as 'hard fun'
        - (...)
    - [[shape]]
        - 'your offer' -- is there a better word than offer for a generic audience that is not necessarily in a for-profit/in the market? unsure
    - [[design from trust]]
        - assumes good intent -- without being naïve
        - designs systems around the good actors
        - nice -- but how does it fit within the framework? it seems to be a pattern or a lens through which to inform shift/shape?
    - [[aikido]] -> [[upkido]]
        - integrative, positive approach to life; uplift, upward spiral
        - mindfulness practice
    - [[set]]
        - a course, in motion, expectations
        - cool example from polynesian navigators
    - [[recap]]
        - some of the suggestions seemed like they could belong earlier in a 4s section -- for example 'invite a contrarian to coffee' could be in 'shift'?
        - taboos could be mentioned earlier in particular, and linked to the kodak example/the blindspots of an established enterprise.
        - design from trust and upkido could be more detailed and maybe intertwined throught he presentation

# Other feedback

- I missed a slide on who you are / why you are here -- and ideally on how this relates to the framework you'll be presenting.
- Generative AI seemed not core to the presentation, you could drop it and make room for one more top level concept to mention early on?
- [[Upkido]] made me wonder what it was, nice name :)
- Consider having a map somewhere towards the beginning or as a recurring term -- this would match your way of thinking incidentally, and also show the audience which things you're mentioning en passant
