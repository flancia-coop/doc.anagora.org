# Feedback

- On 'impossible' intro slide: 'long' and abstract slides like this would probably work better standing up/on a stage, but the examples you gave otherwise seemed like they could have done with some 'slide support'.
- You started with this question but it wasn't clear to me how it related to the objective of the session. 

## General

- [[Upkido]] made me wonder what it was.
