# Feedback

- On 'impossible' intro slide: 'long' and abstract slides like this would probably work better standing up/on a stage, but the examples you gave otherwise seemed like they could have done with some 'slide support'.
- You started with this question but it wasn't clear to me how it related to the objective of the session. 
- Two angles:
    - Generative AI
    - Trust
- ...but angles for what? Five minutes in I had forgotten :) I think it was about effective change? But it could have gotten a slide to reinforce/make it clear at the beginning.

# Other

- [[Upkido]] made me wonder what it was.
