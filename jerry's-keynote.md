- a [[presentation]].
    - I saw on [[2024-05-31]].

# Per-slide feedback

- On 'impossible' intro slide: 'long' and abstract slides like this would probably work better standing up/on a stage, but the examples you gave otherwise seemed like they could have done with some 'slide support'.
- You started with this question but it wasn't clear to me how it related to the objective of the session. 
- Two angles:
    - Generative AI
    - Trust
- ...but angles for what? Five minutes in I had forgotten :) I think it was about effective change? But it could have gotten a slide to reinforce/make it clear at the beginning.
    - this slide also seemed very small/bare after the previous one
- [[joy line]] angle
    - the 'lesser car' looked fine to me -- maybe you need a worse example? :D
- [[rethink constraints]] slide came later and cleared up the question I had above -- I think you probably want another version of this slide early on

(~fifteen minute mark)

- [[traffic calming]]
- [[generative ai]] moving the [[impossible line]]
- framework -- [[4s]]:
    - [[see shift shape set]]
    - [[see]]
        - slides on what 'see' means seem like they maybe aren't as needed and you could go straight to your quote.
        - [[constraints]]
            - nice examples for organizational vs personal
            - the odd benefits of being an outcast -- interesting facts about [[quakers]]
        - on flipping away from [[systems designed from mistrust]]
        - [[John Taylor Gatto]] on the [[Hidden Curriculum of Schooling]]:
            - Stay in the class where you belong
            - Turn on and off when I tell you to
            - Surrender your will to a predestined chain of command
            - Only I determine what curriculum you will study
            - Your  self-respect should depend on an observer's measure of your worth
            - You are being watched
            - -> this was great but I felt that you maybe shifted away from this slide without fully driving the point across.
        - Your mission tomorrow
            - Enumerate your constraints
            - Examine your assumptions
            - Look for imbalances
            - How ought things be?
    - [[shift]]
        - Liked its description as 'hard fun'
        - (...)
    - [[shape]]
        - (...)
- [[design from trust]]
    - assumes good intent -- without being na√Øve
    - designs systems around the good actors
    - nice -- but how does it fit within the framework? it seems to be a pattern or a lens through which to 

# Other feedback

- [[Upkido]] made me wonder what it was, nice :)
- I missed a slide on who you are / why you are here -- and ideally on how this relates to the framework you'll be presenting.
