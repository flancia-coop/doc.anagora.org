@ArchLeucoryx â€” daytura, just "day" is good

Quick and dirty longer bio. hihi this is daytura. RIP Agorabot on Twitter! Wikilink everything really could've been great :(

(Twitter) nerd, interested in tools for thought and personal metacognition. Pivoting out of fandom stuff but I'm open to discussion about it. You may see me try poetry. Open to making friends--DMs are open, or just @-mention me on Twitter!
