Quick and dirty longer bio. hihi this is daytura. RIP Agorabot on Twitter! Wikilink everything really could've been great :(

(Twitter) nerd, interested in tools for thought and personal metacognition. Pivoting out of fandom stuff but I'm open to discussion about it. You may see me try poetry. Open to making friends--DMs are open, or just @-mention me on Twitter!

April 19th 2022 update: "roxytonic ad astra" is complete! It's a public synthesis of everything I've learned from 1 year of mcytblr fandom.

June 3rd 2023 update: Moved past personal knowledge management and tools for thought (fancy note-taking) for the time being, and on account that I'm a proper cognitive science major now. Very far from fandom and honestly it feels great. Looking forward to where this new major takes me.
