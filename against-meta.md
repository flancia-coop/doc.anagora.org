## Introduction

This is a working document for an upcoming vote for to defederate from threads.net following the [Meta Community Guidelines](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-dampens-hate-speech-policy/) updates.

It is currently: DRAFT/BEING WRITTEN. If there is consensus I will use this text to start a vote on this key issue affecting the [[sociail.coop]] community, or one of you working on this with me will do so if you wish :)

For context about how we got here as a community, please see https://wiki.social.coop/wiki/Federation_with_Threads in the Social.coop wiki.
    
## Proposal
    
Defederate from threads.net immediately, meaning applying the SUSPEND policy in Mastodon, due to their updated policies regarding permissable hate speech impacting the LGBTQ+ community and those who may be perceived as immigrants. This policy is in violation of the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant) rule 1.

Vote will be run on Loomio starting on the weekend of the January 10th, 2025.
