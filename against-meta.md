This is a working document for an upcoming vote for to defederate from threads.net following the January 9, 2025 updates.

It is currently: DRAFT/BEING WRITTEN. If there is consensus I will use this text to start a vote on this key issue affecting the [[sociail.coop]] community, or one of you working on this with me will do so if you wish :)

## Proposal
    
Defederate from threads.net immediately, meaning applying the SUSPEND policy in Mastodon, due to their updated policies regarding speech about the LGBTQ+ community.
