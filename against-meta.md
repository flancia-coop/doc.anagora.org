## Introduction

This is a working document for an upcoming vote to grant an exception to Social.coop's [Federation abuse policy](https://wiki.social.coop/wiki/Federation_abuse_policy) for Threads.net, following the [Meta Community Guidelines](https://opentermsarchive.org/en/memos/meta-dampens-hate-speech-policy/) updates.

It is currently: a DRAFT or work in progress. If there is consensus we will use this text to start a vote on this key issue affecting the [[social.coop]] community.

For historical context about how we got here, please see https://wiki.social.coop/wiki/Federation_with_Threads in the Social.coop wiki.
    
## Proposal

Grant an exception to S

Defederate from threads.net immediately, meaning applying the SUSPEND policy in Mastodon, due to their updated policies regarding permissable hate speech impacting the LGBTQ+ community and immigrants. This policy endorsed by corporation [[Meta]] is considered in violation of the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant) rule 1, and thus in breach of widely agreed on Fediverse guidelines.
