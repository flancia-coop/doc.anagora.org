Ahoy there!

We recently moved from [[etherpad]] to [[hedgedoc]] for the default stoa, so some data is missing. It will be restored at a later time.

In the meantime, the old index stoa can be seen here: https://stoa.anagora.org/index. The same goes for any other stoas.

Perhaps they should be linked everywhere? At the very least.

I like the interface of this one better so far. Is that why you swapped them out?

Hello, my friend! Glad to see you here :) It was partly the interface and the fact that it supports things like images and tables out of the box; partly that this is essentially a Markdown editor, and so it goes well with the Agora (most of the current users use Markdown).
