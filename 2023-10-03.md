Here I would like to take the opportunity to say that the [[HedgeDoc]] Stoa, although it could be much improved, is already useful.

I think I'm going to start using it more often. And maybe enable logins? It seems to have [[oauth]] integration...

Which reminds me I want to work on that for the [[Agora]] proper, and maybe also on [[Google docs]] integration...
