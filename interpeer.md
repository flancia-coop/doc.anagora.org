# Interpeer Project

**The Interpeer Project’s mission is to enable a human centric next generation internet.**

Computers have become ubiquitous. However, the most popular protocol connecting users to remote machines, HTTP, follows an obsolete philosophy:

- that a third party machine owns user data, and users may be permitted access it;
- that a third party machine manages many user’s data, but users connect to it at any time via a single device only;
- that the best way for users to share data between them is for a third party machine to arbitrate this process;
- that sharing data between multiple devices of a user is also arbitrated by a third party machine;
- that sharing always means the data traverses the third party machine;
- etc.

Take printing as an example. The state of the art requires a user’s device to beg a third party machine to allow them to download a document they technically own and then to upload it to another machine that prints it, potentially passing through one or more other machines along the way.

What if instead users could simply instruct a printer to fetch the document on their behalf?

**We need an Internet that reflects modern usage patterns.** Humans own their data. Humans use many devices simultaneously. Humans share data between devices and each other.

**Cryptography allows users to securely delegate trust** to any number of devices, even those they don’t know directly.

**Peer-to-peer networking technology enables trust delegated machines to share data** directly and efficiently. While there are may P2P technologies available, almost none of them focus on efficiency.

Our goal is to provide a secure and efficient peer-to-peer networking stack that will empower a human centric internet, circumventing the protocols of the past. The future is fully distributed.
