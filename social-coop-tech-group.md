- Location: https://socialcoop.meet.coop/dav-y3e-c21-sgv 
- Attending: 3wc, edsu, protean, flancian
    - These will be crossposted to [[go/twg/minutes]].
- Default agenda
    - [[check ins]]
        - (done, all well)
        - welcome back [[ian]] ~ [[protean]] was last active in 2018, tuning back into fediverse 
            - Ian brings back a big chunk of context from the time were Mayel and Etienne (sp?) were calling it quits
            - Ian and the Two Nicks, did a transition already -- knows where are the things that you need to know if you want to get anything done.
    - suggested topics follow, please add more :)
        - [[documentation]] source of truth
            - [[big documentation reorg]] took place thanks to Ian, Nathan also did some improvements
            - default: [[go/twg/wiki]]
            - how we understand how wiki works:
                - [[edsu]] [[ansible repo]] checks out [[general.wiki]] and [[wiki.social.coop]] repos, massages them and deploys them to [[runko]]?
                - [[edsu]] there's a web hook (in one or both? unclear) when you commit to the wiki, documented
                - [[flancian]] I keep not remembering what goes in general.wiki and what goes wiki.social.coop
            - report back to https://www.loomio.com/d/2Rwh5z3H/time-to-consolidate-wikis- (as per [[nathan schneider]]'s request.)
                - how we understand the proposal:
                    - option one: consolidate (move) twg.wiki (tech/operations repo), cwg.wiki (community/operations) into general.wiki, which gets processed and deployed from ansible?
                    - option two: change [[ansible playbook]] to also check out the twg and cwg wikis and somehow integrate them at deployment step
                - pros/cons of these approaches
                    - do we want to keep anything in the wiki secret?
                        - [[ian]] there might be a grey area for things like management interfaces (URLs), but by and large the right default option is public
                        - things that keep your logs clean
                    - some documentation lives with the ansible repo as well
                    - any pros to option two?
                    - cons: makes linking between repos more difficult, [[edsu]]: it's nice to think of it as one knowledge base
                    - **[[default]]: we'll report back that we'll consolidate into [[general.wiki]]**
        - [[operations]] source of truth for our tech group work
            - nine repositories currently, counting three wiki
            - [[flancian]]: I'd like to designate one repository as 'clone this first' and add a ./bootstrap-local.sh script which clones all social.coop repos to begin with.
            - [[flancian]]: then work on ./bootstrap-prod.sh :)
            - [[flancian]]: what's the best repo for that? is it [[ansible]] because of how we want to use automation for this, in particular for ./bootstrap-prod.sh?
            - flancian: originally thought tech-operations but maybe ansible?
            - [[protean]]: as he was doing the documentation revamp he leaned towards *not* putting everything in ansible
                - the setup we have may be partly influenced by the lack of group wikis in gitlab at the time of design
                - question: when you want to use the ansible repo, the way it's intended to be used:
                    - you have your ssh key in your local machine that you're working on
                    - you clone the ansible repo
                    - you run the playbook locally and that connects and alters the server
                    - we could make a playbook for things currently in the sauce
                - [[ian]] if we want to go to the server and clone something there, that workflow (which comes more natural to some) just doesn't fit the above a lot
                    - unclear if there is a big advantage of moving [[docker compose]] stuff to [[ansible]], it's mostly one file
                    - [[ansible repo]] should indeed install docker, docker compose though
                    - [[flancian]] ansible did feel like a learning curve when starting
                    - [[edsu]] should we use [[ansible]] to do upgrades? maybe we could tackle [[mastodon upgrade]] this way and learn from that?
                    - [[ian]] even at work, ansible manages the stages from bare metal to deployment ready.
        - [[mastodon upgrade]]
            - backup restores as a prereq for mastodon upgrade process? or is that too conservative?
        - second server for testing backup/restore
        - [[edsu]]: should we set up some time for live collaboration to work?

## Several past instances had notes only on [[loomio]]

    - [[flancian]]: OK with taking notes in doc.anagora.org/social-coop-tech-group? will cross-post to the minutes thread as usual.
    - attending: [[giacomo sansoni]] [[flancian]] [[akshay mankar]]
    - [[akshay]]
        - long holiday in Berlin, very nice!
        - don't work on Fridays, and yesterday was a holiday
        - [[wire swiss gmbh]]
        - [[mls]]
            - open standard
            - wire's implementation is based on [[haskell]]
            - tree based optimization to group encryption
    - [[flancian]]
        - working for Google, [[meet]]
    - [[flancian]] wdyt about [[matrix]]?
    - [[agenda]]
        - [[flancian]]
            - updates on ongoing work/learning
                - did admin task for user who wanted to reactive account
                    - [[akshay]] did you document?
                    - **[[flancian]] not in git.coop, will do that next :)**
                - learning containers, got a container up nicely yesterday
                - will keep poking at our setup and trying to understand the ansible recipes
        - stuff we could do next
            - **[[akshay mankar]] file bug in mastodon bug tracker for extra fields in the mastodon sign up form**
                - how do we handle user data in the long term? user data handling policy, etc.
                - started writing the issue but then stopped to better understand how the solution would look like
                - perhaps we should have an instance to experiment with
                    - [[flancian]] we might have this -- need to check containers and docs
                    - if not we should create it :)
                - mastodon already probably supports a good way to store information you got in the signup request, we could adapt it -- perhaps encode
            - [[akshay]] the idea here would be to send a PR to upstream instead of forking/applying our own path.
            - **[[flancian]] this seems to raise the priority of updating the instance to latest mastodon**
    - [[later]]
        - media issues?
            - one user reported them
            - [[akshay]] tusky sometimes show images as attachments
            - [[flancian]] get 500s relatively often when trying to upload
            - **[[akshay]] images go to [[s3]] in [[digital ocean]]**
            - **how do we look at logs?**
        - [[backups]] and [[restore]]
            - related to [[data management]] as well as we want to be careful/responsible with our user's data
            - where can we put these backups in? how do we extend the list of acceptable servers?
            - currently backups go to a [[s3]], but where to restore?
            - **how to make sure we don't mess up with the fediverse if we test restores?**
            - also related to the issue of [[failover]] in mastodon -- how is it supposed to work?
                - [[akshay]] you fail over the database, then frontends can all use the new primary
                - you need to solve balancing for the frontend or manually fail over that as well
    - [[akshay]] not attending the next one
        - attending [[zurihack]]!
        - let's meet!
