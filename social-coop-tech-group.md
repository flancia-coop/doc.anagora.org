                - did admin task for user who wanted to reactive account
                - 
        - stuff we could do next
            - **[[akshay mankar]] file bug in mastodon bug tracker for extra fields in the mastodon sign up form**
                - how do we handle user data in the long term? user data handling policy, etc.
                - started writing the issue but then stopped to better understand how the solution would look like
                - perhaps we should have an instance to experiment with
                    - [[flancian]] we might have this -- need to check containers and docs
                    - if not we should create it :)
                - mastodon already probably supports a good way to store information you got in the signup request, we could adapt it -- perhaps encode
            - [[akshay]] the idea here would be to send a PR to upstream instead of forking/applying our own path.
            - **[[flancian]] this seems to raise the priority of updating the instance to latest mastodon**
    - [[later]]
