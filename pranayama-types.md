Pranayama is a Sanskrit word that means "life force extension" or "breath control." It is a practice in Hinduism and Yoga that consists of various techniques of breathing, including the control of the volume and speed of breath. There are several types of pranayama, each with its own unique benefits and methods. Here are a few:

    [[Nadi Shodhana Pranayama]] (Alternate Nostril Breathing): This technique involves breathing in and out through alternate nostrils, which is believed to balance the flow of energy in the body.
    [[Kapalbhati Pranayama]] (Skull-Shining Breath): This is a rapid, forceful exhale through the nose, followed by a passive inhale. It is believed to cleanse the mind and energize the body.
    [[Anulom Vilom Pranayama]] (Balanced Breathing): This technique involves inhaling through one nostril, holding the breath, and then exhaling through the other nostril. It is believed to balance the flow of energy in the body and improve lung function.
    [[Bhastrika Pranayama]] (Bellows Breath): This is a rapid, forceful breath that is done through both nostrils. It is believed to energize the body and clear the mind.
    [[Ujjayi Pranayama]] (Victorious Breath): This technique involves slightly constricting the throat while breathing in and out through the nose. It is believed to calm the mind and improve concentration.

Remember, it's important to learn and practice pranayama techniques under the guidance of a qualified teacher to ensure they are done correctly and safely.
