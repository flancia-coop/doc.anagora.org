# In Search of a Nice Team Wiki

## Overview

Pete is joining a new startup team who are very engaged in the team's business work, but who are not very technical.

What are some possible team wikis we might use?

## Google Docs

::rolls eyes::

## Massive Wiki

https://massive.wiki/

Too free-form, no realtime collaborative editing, sync is either too technical (Git) or too brittle for multiple users (Obsidian Sync).

Otherwise, it's perfect. :-)

(Engineering will have one or more Massive Wikis, of course.)

## Notion

The mainline alternative right now. Too complicated for Pete's taste.

## Outline

Ask Pete kaminski@istori.com for an invite to his test instance started 2024-10-26.

Looks pretty nice, actually. They don't market themselves well, and their 30-day trial is difficult to set up (you need a business account on Google or Microsoft, or you can set up a Slack instance and sneak in that way). But that's a one-time setup thing. (After 30 days, workspaces go read-only but export still works.)

Open source and self-hostable, which is nice.

The organization and editor look easy enough for non-technical folks, and is mostly powerful enough for Pete. Looks like they have nice embedding support, including Grist and Diagrams.net.

The wiki linking is a little wonky. You can do it, but only with Command-K, not double square brackets. If a destination page gets renamed, link text to that page doesn't change (and is not too easy to change by hand). I (Pete) aren't crazy about how this works, but it might be fine for non-technical folks.

## Affine

Looks neat, but it's complicated

## Confluence

No. The only thing worse than Confluence is Jira.
