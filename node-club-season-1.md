- [[What do I think about the Agora?]]
  - I'm voting on a proposal last week [[Why do I like the agora?]] but suggesting we make it broader like [[what do I think about the agora]] or something similar -- [[vera]]
  - +1 [[neil]] sounds good, agreed [[What I think about the agora]] is better, we shouldn't presuppose that people like it! :)
- [[Transition town]]
    - anyone have a link for this? sounds interesting
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_town
    - It's mentioned in the intro to the 30th anniversary edition of [[bolo'bolo]]
    - +1 [[neil]]
- [[Revolution]]

### week 3 (6 Sep-12 Sep) - winner [[bolo'bolo]]

please vote on one or many or add a new suggestion

- [[The Matrix]]

- [[Big Bang]] 
  - the scientific theory
  - [[flancian]] I recently "learnt" (using quotes as I'm not sure how much I'll remember) several things new about this while reading [[david deutsch]] and particular [[max tegmark]], this sounds like a great moment to dump some thoughts on this node
- [[HyperCard]] 
  - the cool thing
  - [[flancian]] good idea, never used it but I remember (fuzzily) reading about it and finding it interesting; would like to learn more
- [[Why do I like Agora?]] 
  - questions / prompts could be interesting
  - [[flancian]] this sounds great, I'd love to read someone else's thoughts on the Agora -- but then again I'm biased
- [[bolo'bolo]]
  - +1 [[neil]]



### week 2 (30 Aug-5 Sep) - winner [[Moloch]]

two suggestions rolled over from week.
please vote on one or many or add a new suggestion


- [[howl]]
  - https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl
- [[moloch (poem)]]
  - it's the second part of [[howl]]
  - https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl
  - +1 [[neil]] i like the idea of doing just this part, people can read more of howl if they want.
  - +1 [[flancian]] love it, and I agree, howl is a lot and this is a great entry point
  - +1 [[vera]]
  

### week 1 (23-29 Aug) - decision made

- [[meditations on moloch]]
  - +0 [[neil]] looks like a great essay but I feel it's a bit too long for a weekly node club. i think the source topic should be short and sweet enough to encourage people to node something about it even if they have little time.
      - I agree
- [[howl (poem)]]
  - +1 [[neil]] quite long but not too long
  - Anyone have a link to this?
    - https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl
- [[moloch (poem)]]
  - +1 [[neil]]
  - @[[flancian]] Is this a piece of reading material or just a writing prompt?
    - it's just the second part of [[howl]] I believe
- [[all watched over by machines of loving grace (poem)]] by richard brautigan
  - +1 [[neil]]
  - +1 [[vera]] I like the title on this one
  - +1 [[flancian]] I like this one and recently watched the film/three part series of the same name by [[adam curtis]] so it sounds great to me :)
